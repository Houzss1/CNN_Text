Severe flooding resulted downstream from the dam. In May 2015 a class action lawsuit against the dam operator SunWater was launched by residents affected by the flooding. The class action was dropped in February 2016.The dam's highest recorded level was 102.37% of capacity in March 2017 as a result of heavy rains from ex Tropical Cyclone Debbie. SunWater, the water supply and services company, has undertaken a multi-station upgrade program to ensure highest levels of safety for dams of their responsibility. The Callide spillway was scheduled to be upgraded in the 'medium-term' range from 2008. In 2021, the spillway gates were to be removed and serviced to address vibration during their operation.

Kolan River Barrage,"The Kolan River is a river located in the Bundaberg Region, Queensland, Australia.The river rises in the Bobby Range, below the Dawes Range in the north-east, and the Burnett Range in the south-west. The river flows generally south and then east towards the settlement of Toweran where the Bruce Highway crosses the river. From this point the river flows south by east and enters Lake Monduran, formed in 1978 by the damming of the river in order to mitigate severe flooding in the river's lower reaches. The river then flows east and then finally north by east and reaches its mouth north of Moore Park. The Kolan River is joined by nineteen tributaries including the main tributary, Gin-Gin Creek, a watercourse that is 92 kilometres (57 mi) long. The lower reaches of the river are surrounded by sugar cane fields. The Mouth of Kolan River Regional Park is a protected area at the river mouth. The river descends 515 metres (1,690 ft) over its 195-kilometre (121 mi) course.Other water storage facilities that are supplied with water from the river include the Bucca Weir and the Kolan Barrage.Macfadyena unguis-cati, commonly known as Cats Claw Creeper, is a rapidly growing clinging vine that has been killing gumtrees on the banks of the Kolan River, leaving damaged tracts of riverbank.
