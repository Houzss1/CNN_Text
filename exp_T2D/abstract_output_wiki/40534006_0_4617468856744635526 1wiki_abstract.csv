He was a two-time world champion, having been a one-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, and a one-time World Heavyweight Champion in WWE; he was booked to win a third world championship at a WWE event on the night of his death.

Benoit headlined multiple pay-per-views for WWE, including a victory in the World Heavyweight Championship main event match of WrestleMania XX in March 2004.In a suspected double-murder and suicide, local law enforcement officials concluded ""based on evidence found within the (Benoit family) home"", that Benoit had murdered his wife in their residence on June 22, 2007, had killed his 7-year-old son on June 23, and on June 24 had committed suicide, reportedly hanging himself using equipment in a weight-training area inside the residency basement. Later research undertaken by the Sports Legacy Institute (now the Concussion Legacy Foundation) suggested that depression and CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), a condition of brain damage, from numerous concussions Benoit had sustained during his professional wrestling career were both likely contributing factors of the tragedy.Due to his suspected murders, Benoit's legacy in the pro–wrestling industry has remained incredibly controversial and heavily debated. In spite of his assumed crimes, Benoit has been universally renowned by many for his exceptional technical wrestling ability. Prominent combat sports journalist Dave Meltzer considers Benoit ""one of the top 10, maybe even the top five, all-time greats"" in pro-wrestling history.Benoit was inducted into the Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1995 and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 2003. Benoits WON induction was put to a referendum-style re-vote for WON readers in 2008, a year after the tragedy, to determine if Benoit should remain a member of the WON Hall of Fame, or be removed. Ultimately, the threshold percentage of votes required to remove Benoit set by WON staff was not met, and so Benoit still remains in that Hall of Fame."

Booker T,"Booker Taliaferro Washington (April 5, 1856 – November 14, 1915) was an American educator, author, orator, and adviser to several presidents of the United States. Between 1890 and 1915, Washington was the dominant leader in the African American community and of the contemporary black elite. Washington was from the last generation of black American leaders born into slavery and became the leading voice of the former slaves and their descendants. They were newly oppressed in the South by disenfranchisement and the Jim Crow discriminatory laws enacted in the post-Reconstruction Southern states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Washington was a key proponent of African-American businesses and one of the founders of the National Negro Business League. His base was the Tuskegee Institute, a normal school, later a historically black college in Tuskegee, Alabama at which he served as principal. As lynchings in the South reached a peak in 1895, Washington gave a speech, known as the ""Atlanta compromise"", which brought him national fame. He called for black progress through education and entrepreneurship, rather than trying to challenge directly the Jim Crow segregation and the disenfranchisement of black voters in the South.Washington mobilized a nationwide coalition of middle-class blacks, church leaders, and white philanthropists and politicians, with a long-term goal of building the community's economic strength and pride by a focus on self-help and schooling. With his own contributions to the Black community, Washington was a supporter of racial uplift, but secretly he also supported court challenges to segregation and to restrictions on voter registration.Washington had the ear of the powerful in the America of his day, including presidents. His mastery of the American political system in the later 19th century allowed him to manipulate the media, raise money, develop strategy, network, distribute funds, and reward a cadre of supporters. Nevertheless, opposition to Washington grew, as it became clear that his Atlanta compromise did not produce the promised improvement for most Blacks in the South. William Monroe Trotter and W. E. B. Du Bois, who Bookerites perceived in an antebellum way as ""northern Blacks"", found Washington too accommodationist and his industrial (""agricultural and mechanical"") education inadequate. Washington fought vigorously against them and succeeded in his opposition to the Niagara Movement they tried to found but could not prevent their formation of the NAACP, whose views became mainstream.Black activists in the North, led by Du Bois, at first supported the Atlanta compromise, but later disagreed and opted to set up the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to work for political change. They tried with limited success to challenge Washington's political machine for leadership in the Black community, but built wider networks among white allies in the North. Decades after Washington's death in 1915, the civil rights movement of the 1950s took a more active and progressive approach, which was also based on new grassroots organizations based in the South, such as Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).Washington's legacy has been controversial in the civil rights community. After his death in 1915, he came under heavy criticism for accommodationism to white supremacy, despite his claims that his long-term goal was to end the disenfranchisement of African Americans, the vast majority of whom still lived in the South. However, a more neutral view has appeared since the late 20th century. As of 2010, most recent studies ""defend and celebrate his accomplishments, legacy, and leadership""."

Steve Austin,"Steve Austin (born Steven James Anderson, December 18, 1964; later Steven James Williams) is an American television host, actor, and retired professional wrestler who is better known by his ring name ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin.

After a brief stint in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in late 1995, he signed with the WWF as The Ringmaster. The following year, having grown a goatee and shaved his head, he was repackaged as ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, a trigger-happy ""Texas rattlesnake"".

Austin thus became the ""poster boy"" of the Attitude Era. He was forced to retire from in-ring competition in 2003 due to multiple knee injuries and also a serious neck injury. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, he was featured as an on-screen authority figure of Raw.Austin held 19 championships throughout his wrestling career.

Austin headlined multiple WWF pay-per-view events, including three WrestleManias (XIV, XV, and X-Seven), and he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009.Following his wrestling career, Austin started a podcast named The Steve Austin Show and released an IPA beer called the ""Broken Skull IPA"".
