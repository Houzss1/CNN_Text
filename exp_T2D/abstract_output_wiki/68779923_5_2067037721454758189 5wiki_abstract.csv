Spanish Aymara Quechua Guarani,"Bolivians (Spanish: Bolivianos) are people identified with the country of Bolivia. This connection may be residential, legal, historical or cultural. For most Bolivians, several (or all) of these connections exist and are collectively the source of their being Bolivian.Bolivia is, as its neighboring countries, a multiethnic and multilingual society, home to people of various ethnic, religious, and national origins, with the majority of the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants. As a result, Bolivians do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance to Bolivia. Aside from the indigenous populations, Bolivians trace their ancestry to the Old World, primarily Europe and Africa, ever since the Spanish conquest of South America and founding of first Spanish settlements in the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata.Modern Bolivian population, estimated at 11 million is formally broken down into Amerindians (primarily Quechua and Aymara, Guaraní peoples), Mestizos, Europeans and Afro-Bolivians. The group's sole common language is Spanish (Bolivian Spanish), although the Guarani, Aymara and Quechua languages are also widely spoken in their communities and to some degree by others, and all three, as well as 34 other indigenous languages, are official languages of the country. The mutual influence and interaction of cultures of Bolivia have resulted in modern Bolivian society becoming one of prime examples of a melting pot according to some anthropologists."

Portuguese Tupi Arawak Guarani,"The Tupi or Tupian language family comprises some 70 languages spoken in South America, of which the best known are Tupi proper and Guarani."
Spanish German Mapuche,"The Mapuche conflict (Spanish: conflicto mapuche) involves indigenous Mapuche communities centred in Araucanía and nearby areas of Chile and Argentina. It is often referred to as a conflict between Mapuche communities and the Chilean government or state. Big forestry companies and their contractors, Chilean police and some non-indigenous landowners have been confronted by local Mapuche communities in the context of the conflict.   Mapuche activists demand greater autonomy, recognition of rights, and the return of historical lands. The Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco (CAM) supports the national liberation of the Mapuche people from Chile. The Mapuche conflict intensified following the return of democracy in the 1990s, with Mapuche activists seeking to rectify the loss of ancestral territory during the Arauco War. The Mapuche lack a central organization and individuals and communities carry out their struggle independently and by different means.  The conflict has received the attention of international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, who have criticized the Chilean government's treatment of the Mapuche. The Chilean government's usage of the ""Anti-Terrorism Law"" in the conflict is a focal point of the controversy surrounding the conflict. In 2013, the United Nations condemned the use of the Anti-Terrorism Law against Mapuche activists."
Spanish Arawak Carib,"The Arawak are a group of indigenous peoples of South America and of the Caribbean. Specifically, the term ""Arawak"" has been applied at various times to the Lokono of South America and the Taíno, who historically lived in the Greater Antilles and northern Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean. All these groups spoke related Arawakan languages."
Spanish Quechua,"Quechua (, US also ; Spanish: [ˈketʃwa]), usually called Runasimi (""people's language"") in Quechuan languages, is an indigenous language family spoken by the Quechua peoples, primarily living in the Peruvian Andes. Derived from a common ancestral language, it is the most widely spoken pre-Columbian language family of the Americas, with an estimated 8–10 million speakers as of 2004. Approximately 25% (7.7 million) of Peruvians speak a Quechuan language.It is perhaps most widely known for being the main language family of the Inca Empire. The Spaniards encouraged its use until the Peruvian struggle for independence of the 1780s. As a result, Quechua variants are still widely spoken today, being the co-official language of many regions and the second most spoken language family in Peru."

Spanish Guarani,"Guaraní (), specifically the primary variety known as Paraguayan Guarani (avañeʼẽ [ʔãʋãɲẽˈʔẽ] ""the people's language""), is a South American language that belongs to the Tupi–Guarani family of the Tupian languages. It is one of the official languages of Paraguay (along with Spanish), where it is spoken by the majority of the population, and where half of the rural population is monolingual. It is spoken by communities in neighboring countries, including parts of northeastern Argentina, southeastern Bolivia and southwestern Brazil, and is a second official language of the Argentine province of Corrientes since 2004; it is also an official language of Mercosur.Guaraní is one of the most widely spoken American languages, and remains commonly used among the Paraguayan people and neighboring communities. This is unique among American languages; language shift towards European colonial languages (in this case, the other official language of Spanish) has otherwise been a nearly universal phenomenon in the Western Hemisphere, but Paraguayans have maintained their traditional language while also adopting Spanish.Jesuit priest Antonio Ruiz de Montoya, who in 1639 published the first written grammar of Guarani in a book called Tesoro de la lengua guaraní (Treasure of the Guarani Language /  The Guarani Language Thesaurus), described it as a language ""so copious and elegant that it can compete with the most famous [of languages]"".The name ""Guarani"" is generally used for the official language of Paraguay. However, this is part of a dialect chain, most of whose components are also often called Guarani."

Dutch Pidgin English,"Ghanaian Pidgin English (GhaPE), is a Ghanaian English-lexifier pidgin also known as Pidgin, Broken English, and Kru English (kroo brofo in Akan). GhaPE is a regional variety of West African Pidgin English spoken in Ghana, predominantly in the southern capital, Accra, and surrounding towns. It is confined to a smaller section of society than other West African creoles, and is more stigmatized, perhaps due to the importance of Twi, an Akan dialect, often spoken as lingua franca . Other languages spoken as lingua franca in Ghana are Standard Ghanian English (SGE) and Akan.  GhaPE cannot be considered a creole as it has no L1 speakers.GhaPE can be divided into two varieties, referred to as ""uneducated"" or ""non-institutionalized"" pidgin and ""educated"" or ""institutionalized"" pidgin. The former terms are associated with uneducated or illiterate people and the latter are acquired and used in institutions such as universities and are influenced by Standard Ghanaian English.GhaPE, like other varieties of West African Pidgin English, is also influenced locally by the vocabulary of the indigenous languages spoken around where it developed. GhaPE's substrate languages such as Akan influenced use of the spoken pidgin in Ghana. Other influencers of GhaPE include Ga, Ewe, and Nzema. While females understand GhaPE, they are less likely to use it in public or professional settings. Mixed-gender groups more often converse in SGE or another language. Adults and children have traditionally not spoken GhaPE.In some cases, educators have unsuccessfully attempted to ban the use of pidgin. Although other languages of Ghana are available to them, students, particularly males, use GhaPE as a means of expressing solidarity, camaraderie and youthful rebellion.  Today, this form of Pidgin can be heard in a variety of informal contexts, although it still carries a certain stigma. Specifically, GhaPE still carries stigma in academia which may explain why ""few structural or sociolinguistic descriptions of the variety have been published"". Contemporary GhaPE is spoken by 20% of the population with 5 million speakers. In general, pidgins are spoken in a wide range of situations and occasions including: ""educational institutions, work places, airports, seaports, drinking places, markets, on the radio, popular songs, and on political platforms"".Nigerians who settled in Ghana and vice versa have been major factors in the development and use of the language. GhPE, like other varieties of West African Pidgin English is influenced locally by the vocabulary of the indigenous languages spoken around where it developed, in this case, as around the Greater Accra Region, largely Ga. When spoken, it can be difficult for Nigerian pidgin speakers to understand Ghanaian speakers, for instance, the words ""biz"" which stands for ""ask"", ""kai"" which means ""remember"" and ""gbeketii"" meaning ""in the evening"" in the Standard Ghanaian English.Also, young educated men who were raised outside Accra and Tema very often do not know it until they come into contact with others who do at boarding-school in secondary school or at university. But that might be changing, as Accra-born students go to cities such as Ghana's second city Kumasi to study at university and so could help gain the language new diverse speakers.Over the years, some young Ghanaian writers have taken to writing literary pieces such as short stories in GhPE as an act of protest. GhPE has also seen expression in songs and movies and in advertisements."
