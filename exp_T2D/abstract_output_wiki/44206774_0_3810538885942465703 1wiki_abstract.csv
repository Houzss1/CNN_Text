Mark O\u0027Meara,"O-GlcNAc (short for O-linked GlcNAc or O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine) is a reversible enzymatic post-translational modification that is found on serine and threonine residues of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. The modification is characterized by a β-glycosidic bond between the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine side chains and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). O-GlcNAc differs from other forms of protein glycosylation: (i) O-GlcNAc is not elongated or modified to form more complex glycan structures, (ii) O-GlcNAc is almost exclusively found on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins rather than membrane proteins and secretory proteins, and (iii) O-GlcNAc is a highly dynamic modification that turns over more rapidly than the proteins which it modifies. O-GlcNAc is conserved across metazoans.Due to the dynamic nature of O-GlcNAc and its presence on serine and threonine residues, O-GlcNAcylation is similar to protein phosphorylation in some respects. While there are roughly 500 kinases and 150 phosphatases that regulate protein phosphorylation in humans, there are only 2 enzymes that regulate the cycling of O-GlcNAc: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyze the addition and removal of O-GlcNAc, respectively. OGT utilizes UDP-GlcNAc as the donor sugar for sugar transfer.First reported in 1984, this post-translational modification has since been identified on over 5,000 proteins. Numerous functional roles for O-GlcNAcylation have been reported including crosstalking with serine/threonine phosphorylation, regulating protein-protein interactions, altering protein structure or enzyme activity, changing protein subcellular localization, and modulating protein stability and degradation. Numerous components of the cell's transcription machinery have been identified as being modified by O-GlcNAc, and many studies have reported links between O-GlcNAc, transcription, and epigenetics. Many other cellular processes are influenced by O-GlcNAc such as apoptosis, the cell cycle, and stress responses. As UDP-GlcNAc is the final product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which integrates amino acid, carbohydrate, fatty acid, and nucleotide metabolism, it has been suggested that O-GlcNAc acts as a ""nutrient sensor"" and responds to the cell's metabolic status. Dysregulation of O-GlcNAc has been implicated in many pathologies including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders."
Gene Sauers,"Gene Craig Sauers (born August 22, 1962) is an American professional golfer, currently playing on the PGA Tour Champions.

He won the U.S. Senior Open in 2016, a senior major championship .Born in Savannah, Georgia, Sauers started him playing golf at the age of nine with his father. He attended Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, turned pro, and joined the PGA Tour in 1984.Sauers has four dozen top-10 finishes in PGA Tour events including three official wins. His first win was in 1986 at the Bank of Boston Classic; his second came at the 1989 Hawaiian Open; his third, which came after a 13-year hiatus, was in 2002 at the final edition of the Air Canada Championship in British Columbia. He also won the Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic in Mississippi in 1990, opposite the Masters in April, before it was an official money event.He finished two other tournaments in a tie for first place at the end of regulation: the 1992 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, which he lost on the fourth extra hole of a playoff to John Cook, and the St. Jude Classic in 1994, which he and Hal Sutton lost to Tour rookie Dicky Pride. After his win in Canada, Sauers received the PGA Comeback Player of the Year award in 2002. His best finish in a major was a tie for second at the PGA Championship in 1992.Sauers lost his tour card in 1995 and had to play primarily on the Nike Tour until his PGA Tour victory in 2002 with its two-year exemption. He recorded one victory on the Nike Tour at the 1998 Nike South Carolina Classic, and about a dozen top-10 finishes.Sauers competed on the PGA Tour until 2005. From 2006 to 2010, he did not compete professionally after an initial misdiagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis turned out to be Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and he was given only a 25-percent chance of survival. Over several months, during which he received multiple skin grafts that left visible scarring, he gradually recovered.Sauers finally overcame the disease and played a limited Nationwide Tour schedule in 2011 and 2012 before making his Champions Tour debut at the Boeing Classic near Seattle in 2012. He earned two top-10 finishes in 2012 and was also inducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame. Playing a full season in 2013, Sauers was twice a runner-up, including a playoff loss to Esteban Toledo at the Insperity Invitational. He finished nineteenth on the Champions Tour money list.In the first six months of 2014, Sauers played in eleven events, with six top-25 finishes and a best of T-15 at the Allianz Championship in early February. At the U.S. Senior Open in Oklahoma in July, he was tied with Colin Montgomerie after 72 holes but lost in a three-hole playoff.Two years later in 2016, Sauers earned his first win as a senior at the U.S. Senior Open in Ohio."
