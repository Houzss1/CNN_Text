Some well-known Kafi poets are Baba Farid, Bulleh Shah, Shah Hussain, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai,  Sachal Sarmast and Khwaja Ghulam Farid. This poetry style has also lent itself to the Kafi genre of singing, popular throughout South Asia, especially Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. Over the years, both Kafi poetry and its rendition have experienced rapid growth phases as various poets and vocalists added their own influences to the form, creating a rich and varied poetic form, yet through it all it remained centered on the dialogue between the Soul and the Creator, symbolized by the murid (disciple) and his Murshid (Master), and often by lover and his Beloved.The word Kafi is derived from the Arabic kafa meaning group. The genre is said to be derived from the Arabic poetry genre, qasidah, a monorhyme ode that is always meant to be sung, using one or two lines as a refrain that is repeated to create a mood. Kafi poetry is usually themed around heroic and great romantic tales from the folkfore, often used as a metaphor for mystical truths, and spiritual longing."

It is noted for being the first radio station in the United States to adopt a 24-hour broadcast schedule. In 1950, it became the flagship station for the short-lived Progressive Broadcasting System radio network.From the 1960s to around 1997, and again in the early 2000s, the programming consisted of R&B, classic soul, and gospel music. For a short time in the late 1970s, after the ratings success of similarly-formatted KDAY, the call letters were changed to KKTT, ""The Cat,"" in an attempt to modernize KGFJ's image. During the Los Angeles riots in 1992, KGFJ briefly adopted a talk format.  During the 1960s and early 1970s, KGFJ was a well-respected and influential soul music outlet, with many top name DJs, including Hunter Hancock, Lucky Pierre, Larry McCormick and the Magnificent Montague. KGFJ also had a popular Sunday morning talk show called, ""Pat's Points"", hosted by Pat (Patricia) Newman (1935-1981), which featured guests.  Among the many personalities heard on the station in the 1960s were Johnny Magnus, Rudy Harvey, Herman Griffith, Curtis Troupe, Jim Randolph, Tom Reed, Roland Bynum [who replaced Montague when he retired, as Soulfinger], Frankie Crocker, Johnny Soul (Ron Samuels) and Russ O'Hara.  KGFJ's studios were located on Melrose near the Hollywood Freeway overpass (the building has since been demolished).A recreated example of KGFJ's R&B programming in the late 1950s can be found on Ron Jacobs' ""Cruisin' 1959"" (Increase Records INCR 5-2004). This recreation features DJ Hunter Hancock and includes several classic R&B songs of that era, contemporary commercials (e.g., Champion spark plugs, the Saturday Evening Post, and others), and DJ patter.Between the two eras of black-oriented formats, KGFJ was KYPA, ""Your Personal Achievement"" radio. The station, as well as AM 820 in Chicago, aired mainly recorded content from motivational speakers, including condensed seminar speeches and interviews with business executives.In 2002, the current format was adopted and the KYPA call sign restored.The station has removed their roof-top wire antenna (despite its historical significance as likely the last ""hammock""  style antenna in the U.S.). It is transmitting from a new site northwest of Dodger Stadium using two of the towers in the six-tower array of co-owned KBLA.KYPA is one of only two stations on 1230 kHz in the United States to use a directional antenna during daytime hours. At night it is the only one.In August 2020, KYPA has recently expanded its reach using FM frequencies in different counties of Southern California. Counties include Orange, Irvine, Ventura and Kern County."
