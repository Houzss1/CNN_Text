CYANIDE,"A cyanide is a chemical compound that contains the group C≡N. This group, known as the cyano group, consists of a carbon atom triple-bonded to a nitrogen atom.In inorganic cyanides, the cyanide group is present as the anion CN−. Soluble salts such as sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide are highly toxic. Hydrocyanic acid, also known as hydrogen cyanide, or HCN, is a highly volatile liquid that is produced on a large scale industrially.  It is obtained by acidification of cyanide salts.Organic cyanides are usually called nitriles. In nitriles, the CN group is linked by a covalent bond to carbon.  For example, in acetonitrile, the cyanide group is bonded to methyl (CH3). Alhough nitriles generally do not release cyanide ions, the cyanohydrins do and are thus rather toxic.The word cyanide is derived from the Greek kyanos, meaning dark blue; the color of Prussian blue used to prepare the compound."
