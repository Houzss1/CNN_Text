Regarding the definition used in the Alps by the Swiss Alpine Club it cannot be called a mountain (nor even a peak with a strict definition) but only a location at the end of a ridge descending from the Vorab in the Glarus Alps.As the location has no distinctive peak nor sudden drops in its gentle sides, it is absolutely not an impressive mountain but even more a very appropriate place to run a skiing resort. Comparing to other skiing resorts in Switzerland the missing neighbouring mountains to the south - which is the location of the giant prehistoric Flims Rockslide – make it even more exposed to the sun even at the sun's lowest orbit in deep winter.A very small hut of the Ski Club Flims was the first building on Crap Sogn Gion, still standing there although hardly noticed. From 1962 the area was accessible by platter lift, followed 1967 by the then biggest aerial cable car with cabins to hold as much as 125 passengers, which is still in use today along with several modernised chairlifts.A more recent aerial cable car was built to Crap Masegn, from where another gondola lift leads to the glacier at Vorab, which made the ski resort a safe one in regards of snow even in winters of poor snowfall.For a walk in summer you may find Crap Sogn Gion on Swisstopo Map 1194, Flims, in the 1:25'000 scale.

Ofen,"Gautama Buddha, popularly known as the Buddha (also known as Siddhattha Gotama or Siddhārtha Gautama or Shakyamuni), was an ascetic, a religious leader and teacher who lived in ancient India (c. 6th to 5th century BCE or c. 5th to 4th century BCE). He is regarded as the founder of the world religion of Buddhism, and revered by Buddhists as an enlightened being, who rediscovered an ancient path to freedom from ignorance, craving and the cycle of rebirth and suffering. He taught for around 45 years and built a large following, both monastic and lay. His teaching is based on his insight into the arising of suffering or dissatisfaction and its ending—the state called Nirvana (lit. vanishing or extinguishing).The Buddha was born into an aristocratic family in the Shakya clan, but eventually renounced lay life. According to Buddhist tradition, after several years of mendicancy, meditation, and asceticism, he awakened to understand the workings of the cycle of rebirth and how it can be escaped. The Buddha then traveled throughout the Gangetic plain, teaching and building a religious community. The Buddha taught a middle way between sensual indulgence and the severe asceticism found in the Indian śramaṇa movement. He taught a training of the mind that included ethical training, self-restraint, and meditative practices such as jhana and mindfulness. The Buddha also critiqued the practices of Brahmin priests, such as animal sacrifice and the caste system.A couple of centuries after his death he came to be known by the title Buddha, which means ""Awakened One"" or ""Enlightened One"". Gautama's teachings were compiled by the Buddhist community in the Vinaya, his codes for monastic practice, and the Suttas, texts based on his discourses. These were passed down in Middle Indo-Aryan dialects through an oral tradition. Later generations composed additional texts, such as systematic treatises known as Abhidharma, biographies of the Buddha, collections of stories about the Buddha's past lives known as Jataka tales, and additional discourses, i.e. the Mahayana sutras. Due to his influence on Indian religions, in Vaishnavism he came to be regarded as the 9th avatar of Vishnu."
Il Fil,"In June 2012, following a series of public comments opposing same-sex marriage by Dan T. Cathy, Chick-fil-A's chief executive officer, related issues have arisen between the international fast food restaurant and the LGBT community. This followed reports that Chick-fil-A's charitable endeavor, the S. Truett Cathy-operated WinShape Foundation, had donated millions of dollars to organizations seen by LGBT activists as hostile to LGBT rights. Activists called for protests and boycotts, while supporters of the restaurant chain and opponents of same-sex marriage ate there in support of the restaurant. National political figures both for and against the actions spoke out and some business partners severed ties with the chain. The outcome of the initial controversy was mixed, as Chick-fil-A's sales rose twelve percent to $4.6 billion in the period immediately following the controversy; this was largely attributed to former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee's counter-boycott launched in support of the restaurant. However, the company's public image and standing with the LGBT community was damaged, with the chain facing criticism and condemnation from politicians and gay rights activists, as well as efforts by activists and political officials to ban the restaurant from college campuses, airports, and elsewhere. Chick-fil-A released a statement in July 2012 stating, ""Going forward, our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena."" In March 2014, tax filings for 2012 showed the group stopped funding all but one organization which had been previously criticized, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.In 2017, tax filings showed that the groups supported by Chick-fil-A expanded to include The Salvation Army, which has been seen as counter to LGBTQ rights. In November 2019, Chick-fil-A announced that it would not make contributions in 2020 to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and The Salvation Army. They did not establish any criteria for corporate donations that would rule out future contributions to groups criticized as anti-LGBTQ."

Mutta Sura,"Nikah mut'ah Arabic: نكاح المتعة, romanized: nikāḥ al-mutʿah, literally ""pleasure marriage""; temporary marriage: 1045  or Sigheh (Persian: صیغه ، ازدواج موقت) is a private and verbal temporary marriage contract that is practiced in Twelver Shia Islam in which the duration of the marriage and the mahr must be specified and agreed upon in advance.: 242 : 47–53  It is a private contract made in a verbal or written format. A declaration of the intent to marry and an acceptance of the terms are required as in other forms of marriage in Islam.According to Shia Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned nikah mut'ah (fixed-term marriage, called muta'a in Iraq and sigheh in Iran), which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden. Some Western writers have argued that mut'ah approximates prostitution.Some sources say the Nikah mut'ah has no prescribed minimum or maximum duration, but others, such as The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, indicate the minimum duration of the marriage is debatable and durations of at least three days, three months or one year have been suggested.Some Muslims and Western scholars have stated that both Nikah mut'ah and Nikah misyar are Islamically void attempts to religiously sanction prostitution which is otherwise forbidden. The Zaidi Shia reject Mutah marriage."

Hohegg,"The Lötschberg line is a railway in Switzerland, connecting Spiez in the canton of Bern with Brig in the canton of Valais. It crosses the Bernese Alps, from the Bernese Oberland to Upper Valais, through the Lötschberg Tunnel in the middle of the line. Together with the Simplon Tunnel south of Brig, it constitutes one of the major railways through the Alps and an important north-south axis in Europe. The Lötschberg axis is backed by the lower and longer Lötschberg Base Tunnel, part of the New Railway Links through the Alps project.The line is famous for its double loop of spiral tunnels in the Kander Valley on its northern approach to the Lötschberg Tunnel and the climb out of the Rhone Valley on a steep mountainside through numerous tunnels and viaducts on the southern approach. Its culminating point is 1,240 metres (4,070 ft) above sea level, making it the highest adhesion and standard gauge railway in Switzerland."
Piz Barghis Ringelspitz,"The Ringelspitz (also known as Piz Barghis) is a mountain of the Glarus Alps, located on the border between the Swiss cantons of St. Gallen and Graubünden.

It is split between three municipalities: Pfäfers (St. Gallen), Trin and Tamins (Graubünden).The Ringelspitz is the culminating point of a range, about 12 kilometres long, running from west to east and diverging from the main chain of the Glarus Alp between Piz Sardona and Piz Segnas. The massif separates the Calfeisen valley in canton St. Gallen from the Rhine valley near Flims. The north side of the mountain consists of nearly 2,000 metre-high precipitous cliffs overlooking the Gigerwaldsee (1,335 m)."

Taminser Calanda,"The Calanda is a mountain (more precisely, a massif) in the Glarus Alps with two main peaks: Haldensteiner Calanda (2805 m) and Felsberger Calanda (2697 m), both located on the border between the cantons of St. Gallen and Graubünden in eastern Switzerland. It looms over Chur, the capital city of Graubünden.Although Felsberger Calanda's topographic prominence is 286 metres—enough to possibly be considered a mountain in its own right—the massif is commonly said to be one mountain with several peaks. It lies between the valleys of the Rhine (to the southeast) and the Tamina (to the northwest), and is separated from the Ringelspitz by the Kunkels Pass.The name Calanda derives from the Latin ""calare"", roughly meaning roll down, which refers to the ever-moving southern face that can be seen at Felsberg and is still an active rock slide.The shallow southeastern slopes lie in Graubünden, within the municipalities of Mastrils, Untervaz, Haldenstein, Felsberg and Tamins, whereas most of the steeper slopes on the northwest lie in the Canton of St. Gallen, in the municipality of Pfäfers.Calanda's secondary peaks are called Rossfallenspitz and Güllenchopf, whereas Berger Calanda and Taminser Calanda are less prominent points that mark the ends of the main ridge.On the northerly plateau of Felsberger Calanda, ibexes are regularly seen.A Swiss Alpine Club mountain hut, the Calandahütte, sites on slopes below Haldensteiner Calanda, at an elevation of 2073 m. The two main summits can be reached from the south by hiking: Haldensteiner Calanda by a route rated T3 on the SAC Hiking Scale, and Felsberger Calanda by a T4 route, which requires more experience in routefinding and a head for heights to a certain degree.At Felsberg, the local produced wine is called Goldene Sonne, a reminder of a gold mine in the southern face of Calanda."

Ofen,"Gautama Buddha, popularly known as the Buddha (also known as Siddhattha Gotama or Siddhārtha Gautama or Shakyamuni), was an ascetic, a religious leader and teacher who lived in ancient India (c. 6th to 5th century BCE or c. 5th to 4th century BCE). He is regarded as the founder of the world religion of Buddhism, and revered by Buddhists as an enlightened being, who rediscovered an ancient path to freedom from ignorance, craving and the cycle of rebirth and suffering. He taught for around 45 years and built a large following, both monastic and lay. His teaching is based on his insight into the arising of suffering or dissatisfaction and its ending—the state called Nirvana (lit. vanishing or extinguishing).The Buddha was born into an aristocratic family in the Shakya clan, but eventually renounced lay life. According to Buddhist tradition, after several years of mendicancy, meditation, and asceticism, he awakened to understand the workings of the cycle of rebirth and how it can be escaped. The Buddha then traveled throughout the Gangetic plain, teaching and building a religious community. The Buddha taught a middle way between sensual indulgence and the severe asceticism found in the Indian śramaṇa movement. He taught a training of the mind that included ethical training, self-restraint, and meditative practices such as jhana and mindfulness. The Buddha also critiqued the practices of Brahmin priests, such as animal sacrifice and the caste system.A couple of centuries after his death he came to be known by the title Buddha, which means ""Awakened One"" or ""Enlightened One"". Gautama's teachings were compiled by the Buddhist community in the Vinaya, his codes for monastic practice, and the Suttas, texts based on his discourses. These were passed down in Middle Indo-Aryan dialects through an oral tradition. Later generations composed additional texts, such as systematic treatises known as Abhidharma, biographies of the Buddha, collections of stories about the Buddha's past lives known as Jataka tales, and additional discourses, i.e. the Mahayana sutras. Due to his influence on Indian religions, in Vaishnavism he came to be regarded as the 9th avatar of Vishnu."

Egghorn,"The Tamina is a river in Switzerland that originates on the flanks of Piz Sardona in the Glarus Alps and flows eastwards and northwards to finally merge with the Alpine Rhine after about 18 km total length.Along its way it flows into the reservoir Lake Gigerwald in the Calfeisen valley.  At Vättis it is joined by the Gorbsbach, and flows northeast into the Mapraggsee.  The lower section, heading northwards through Bad Pfäfers, forms a deep and narrow gorge called the Taminaschlucht.  Finally, it meets the Rhine river near Bad Ragaz.Historically, the Tamina valley (Taminatal, also Vättnertal) was owned by the Pfäfers Abbey, joined to the canton of St. Gallen at its formation in 1803."
