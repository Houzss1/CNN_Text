Most if not all properties of 1 can be deduced from this. In advanced mathematics, a multiplicative identity is often denoted 1, even if it is not a number. 1 is by convention not considered a prime number; although universally accepted today, this fact was controversial until the mid-20th century.The unique mathematical properties of the number have led to its unique uses in other fields, ranging from science to sports.
