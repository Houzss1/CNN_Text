Allt Lwyd,"Allt Lwyd is a top of Waun Rydd in the Brecon Beacons National Park, in southern Powys, Wales.The summit is heathery and marked by a small pile of stones. It is found at the end of Waun Rydd's south-east ridge. It overlooks Talybont Reservoir, and has the Talybont Forest on its steep flanks."
Allt-fawr,"Allt-fawr is a mountain in Snowdonia, North Wales and forms part of the Moelwynion group.It is on the internal border of Snowdonia National Park, and overlooks the town of Blaenau Ffestiniog, with its numerous slate quarries, as well as the Tanygrisiau reservoir and power station. On the northern slope of Allt-fawr is the Oakeley Quarry, the world's largest underground slate mine. On the southern slope is the large Cwmorthin Quarry. These two mines are joined underneath the summit of Allt-fawr and the extensive chambering and adits are visible on the surface of the mountain where underground workings have collapsed.Between 1974 and 1997, the Gloddfa Ganol tourist attraction operated within the Oakeley Quarry on the south slope of the mountain."
Aran Benllyn,"Aran Benllyn is a subsidiary summit of Aran Fawddwy in southern Snowdonia, North Wales, Wales, United Kingdom. It is the second highest peak in the Aran mountain range.It rises from the south shore of Llyn Tegid, and tops the northern point on the main Aran ridge. In between it and Aran Fawddwy lies another summit: Erw y Ddafad-ddu.The summit has a few rocky outcrops and is marked by a small cairn. The view include: Llyn Tegid to the north, Foel y Geifr to the east, Erw y Ddafad-ddu to the south and Rhobell Fawr and Cadair Idris to the west.North-east of the summit is a lake, Llyn Lliwbran."
Aran Fawddwy,"Aran Fawddwy is a mountain in southern Snowdonia, Wales, United Kingdom. It is the highest point (county top) of the historic county of Merionethshire (for local government purposes, it lies within the current council area of Gwynedd). It is the only peak in Wales outside North Snowdonia above 900m, and higher than anywhere in Great Britain outside Northern Snowdonia, the Scottish Highlands (and islands) and the Lake District. The nearest urban centres to the mountain are Dinas Mawddwy to the south, Llanymawddwy to the southeast, Llanuwchllyn on the shores of Bala Lake to the north, and Rhydymain to the west. The nearest settlements with around 2,000 people are Bala and Dolgellau. On the eastern slopes of Aran Fawddwy is the small lake named Creiglyn Dyfi, the source of the River Dyfi. Its sister peak is Aran Benllyn at 885 metres (2,904 ft). There is also a middle peak- Erw y Ddafad-ddu.A cairn is placed on the eastern ridge as a memorial to RAF Mountain Rescue team member Michael Robert Aspain who was struck and killed by lightning in 1960."
Arenig Fach,"Arenig Fach is a mountain in southern Snowdonia, north Wales. It is a peak in the Arenig range and lies to the north of its parent peak Arenig Fawr.It lies close to Llyn Celyn alongside the A4212 between Trawsfynydd and Bala. Carnedd y Filiast and Foel Goch (Arenigs) is to the east, while Moel Llyfnant, Gallt y Daren and Arenig Fawr are to the south. The summit itself is known as Carnedd Bachgen, named after the ancient cairn, Carnedd y Bachgen (which lies just north-east of the summit), and is the highest point at the north end of a wide plateau. There is a trig point and a substantial shelter cairn. The mountain rises from the Migneint moorland and looks like a bulky heathery ""lump"" from most directions. However, its north-eastern face has steep cliffs with a small corrie lake, Llyn Arenig Fach, at their bottom. The last glacier occupation of this corrie is thought to have happened during the Loch Lomond Stadial."
Arenig Fawr,"Arenig Fawr (English: Great High Ground) is a mountain in Snowdonia, North Wales, close to Llyn Celyn reservoir, alongside the A4212 between Trawsfynydd and Bala."
Arenig Fawr South Ridge Top,"Arenig Fawr South Ridge Top is a top of Arenig Fawr in southern Snowdonia, North Wales. It lies in area of rocky knolls and small tarns, found on the broad south ridge of Arenig Fawr.The summit, marked by a few stones, is a top of the highest rocky outcrop found in the area. The views are limited, blocked by the bulk of Arenig Fawr. A path leads down the west flank of the ridge towards Moel Llyfnant."
Arenig Fawr South Top,"Arenig Fawr South Top is the twin top of Arenig Fawr in southern Snowdonia, North Wales. It is the second highest member of the Arenig range, being 18 m less than its twin. From here the south ridge continues into an area of rocky knolls and small tarns, where Arenig Fawr South Ridge Top can be found."
Bache Hill,"Bache Hill (Welsh: Bryn Bach) is a subsidiary summit of Rhos Fawr or Great Rhos, in the Radnor Forest in Wales. It is located to the east of Black Mixen. The summit is marked by a trig point built on an ancient burial mound, probably of Bronze Age date, like most of the summit cairns and round barrows in Wales.Some controversy arises from the burial mound; in that 610 metres might be the top of the man-made mound. Some walkers therefore doubt Bache Hill's 2,000-foot status. However, the latest OS Explorer Maps shows a large 610-metre contour round the summit."
Bera Bach,"Bera Bach is a summit, height 807 metres, in the Carneddau mountains in north Wales. It is part of a ridge leading west from Garnedd Uchaf. The summit is a rocky tor, characteristic of the northern Carneddau.  Bera Mawr and Bera Bach are together known as the Berau, meaning 'ricks' or 'stacks'. They are both excellent examples of the area's tors. To the west, the ridge continues to Drosgl. Despite Bach in Welsh meaning small, it is higher than Bera Mawr (mawr in Welsh meaning 'big').Bera Bach can be climbed either from Aber Falls, or alternatively from Bethesda via Gyrn Wigau and Drosgl."
Bera Mawr,"Bera Mawr is a summit in the Carneddau mountains in north Wales, height 794 metres. It and Bera Bach are together known as the Berau, or northern Carneddau. The summit is a large rock tor, characteristic of the western Carneddau. There are views of Llwytmor and Foel-fras to the north-east, Garnedd Uchaf to the south-east, Bera Bach to the south, Drosgl to the west and the Menai to the north-west.The Berau lie to the northwest of the two highest mountains in the Carneddau range: Carnedd Llewelyn and Carnedd Dafydd, both are named after 13th century Princes of Wales, Llywelyn the Great (1172-1240), and his grandson Prince Dafydd ap Gruffudd (1238-1283). It was in a bog in the northern foothills of Bera Mawr, at a place called Nanhysglain, that Prince Dafydd ap Gruffudd and his family were betrayed and captured in June 1283 during the Conquest of Wales by Edward I. In October, Dafydd was executed at Shrewsbury on the orders of Edward I. His death marked the end of the 700-year rule of Gwynedd by the family descended from Cunedda Wledig and an independent Wales."
Black Mixen,"Black Mixen (Welsh: Y Domen Ddu) is a subsidiary summit of Rhos Fawr or Great Rhos in the Radnor Forest. The summit is large peat bog plateau. The summit is marked with a cairn, and is next to a radio transmitter and its building.Black Mixen is the only Nuttall to have a communications mast (a radio transmitter) on its summit. To the east is Bache Hill, to the south are the Black Mountains, to the west is the Great Rhos plateau.The summit cairn is probably of Bronze Age date, with most peaks in the area showing similar barrowss."
Black Mountain,None
Black Mountain South Top,"Black Mountain South Top is a top of Black Mountain in the Black Mountains range that spreads across parts of Powys and Monmouthshire in southeast Wales. It is a top which falls exactly on the Welsh-English border, straddling Powys and Herefordshire. The Offa's Dyke Path passes over the summit.The top is an undistinguished heathery bump on Hatterall Ridge. The summit is marked by a small pile of stones."
Bwlch y Ddwyallt,Bwlch y Ddwyallt is the name commonly applied to the high point of the plateau of Gwaun Cerrig Llwydion in the eastern part of the Brecon Beacons in south Wales. It is a top of Waun Rydd.The plateau reaches its highest point of 754m above sea level on its northern rim overlooking the head of Cwm Cwareli. The name is an odd one to apply to a peak since the Welsh word 'bwlch' generally signifies a col or pass between mountains.
Cadair Berwyn,"Cadair Berwyn or Cader Berwyn is a mountain summit in north-east Wales with a height of 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level. It is the highest point in the Berwyn range, the highest in North East Wales and the highest significant summit in Wales outside the National Parks. Cadair Berwyn and Foel Cedig to the west are the two Marilyns that form the Berwyn range. The undulating plateau of the range also includes a large number of other summits above 2,000 feet (610 m), including satellite summits of Cadair Berwyn and many which are classed as Nuttalls.The mountain lies on main ridge of the Berwyns which runs north–south. The eastern side of the ridge is characterised by steep drops and crags including Craig Berwyn north of the summit and Craig y Llyn to the south.  Craig y Llyn forms the headwall of a cwm, and it is to this that the word cadair (chair in Welsh) presumably refers.  Further north along the ridge is Cadair Bronwen, whilst to south the ridge continues to Moel Sych (Welsh pronunciation: [ˈmɔil ˈsɨːx], meaning 'dry hill').It is often reported that Moel Sych, 1 kilometre (0.6 mi) along the ridge, is of equal height, but Cadair Berwyn's spot height on the Ordnance Survey maps, where the trig point stands, is not the true summit. Cadair Berwyn's summit, 200 metres (220 yd) south of the trig point, is 5 metres (16 ft) taller than Moel Sych. This summit is listed as Cadair Berwyn New Top on the Nuttall list. However, the name given to it by its discoverer, Bernard Wright, was Craig Uchaf.In 1987 Bernard Wright, a rambler from Cheshire, was standing on Cadair Berwyn North Top (then said to be the highest mountain in Clwyd) when he noticed that a nearby peak appeared to be higher. After first denying it, the cartographers at the Ordnance Survey finally admitted that Bernard had discovered a 'new mountain' at 830 metres above sea level. Bernard's name for this peak was Craig Uchaf (highest rock) the topographical name fitting in well with those that the Welsh have been giving their landscape for centuries. Near the summit is a Bronze Age cairn. In 2014, accurate re-surveying using GPS by Myrddyn Phillips added an additional 2 metres to the height. Phillips uses the name Craig Berwyn rather than Cadair Berwyn for this summit.Several other summits in the area are listed as Hewitts or Nuttalls, including Foel Wen ([ˈvɔil ˈwɛn], Welsh for white hill) and Mynydd Tarw ([ˈmɐnɨð ˈtæɾu], bull mountain).Cadair Berwyn is the highest point (county top) of the historic county of Denbighshire. The historic border with Merionethshire also ran through the summit. Moel Sych and Cadair Berwyn North Top had been thought at one time to have been the joint county tops of Denbighshire, but resurveying demoted them as explained previously. In terms of modern administrative units, the summit lies entirely within the Powys council area, though the border with modern Denbighshire council runs very close (about 150 metres (490 ft) to the northwest - the new boundary does not exactly follow the old county boundary). Curiously, the historic county of Denbighshire lies on the eastern side on the main Berwyn ridge, but the modern council lies on the western side. The northern end of the main ridge (Craig Berwyn on the OS map, 790 metres (2,590 ft) height, 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) north of Cadair Berwyn North Top) is the highest point in Wrexham county borough.Cadair Berwyn stands between Snowdon and the Wrekin and blocks their line-of-sight. The view from the summit on a clear day is extensive and includes Snowdon, Cadair Idris, Brecon Beacons, Shropshire Hills, Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, Lake District and the Isle of Man. The peak is the nearest high mountain to a significant fraction of the population of the English Midlands but sees far fewer walkers than equivalent summits in the Lake District and Snowdonia.There is a standing stone in the area, located near the summit between Cadair Berwyn and Tomle. This was re-erected in June 2008 by High Sports. The standing stone can be found at SJ080337.Below the mountain is a small lake, Llyn Lluncaws.On 11 August 1942, a United States Army Air Forces, Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress flying from RAF Polebrook to RAF Burtonwood crashed into the side of Cadair Berwyn resulting in the deaths of all eleven passengers and crew.It is the location, as well as Cadair Bronwen, of an alleged UFO landing in 1974, known as the Berwyn Mountain UFO incident."

Cadair Idris,"Cader Idris is a mountain in the historic county of Meirionnydd, Wales (or Gwynedd council area for local government purposes). It lies at the southern end of the Snowdonia National Park near the town of Dolgellau. The peak, which is one of the most popular in Wales for walkers and hikers, is composed largely of Ordovician igneous rocks, with classic glacial erosion features such as cwms, moraines, striated rocks, and roches moutonnées."
Carnedd Dafydd,"Carnedd Dafydd is a mountain peak in the Carneddau range in Snowdonia, North Wales, and is the third highest peak in Wales, or the fourth if Crib y Ddysgl on the Snowdon ridge is counted.  Situated south-west of Carnedd Llewelyn and north of Pen yr Ole Wen, Carnedd Dafydd is on the main ridge of the Carneddau, and on the border between Gwynedd and Conwy.  The average annual temperature of the mountain is around 3–4 °C.Carnedd Dafydd rises to height of 1,044 m (according to OS maps detail) and is usually climbed by first ascending Pen yr Ole Wen and then following the ridge along to Carnedd Dafydd, though it is also possible to make a direct ascent from Tal y Llyn Ogwen, first following the stream, Afon Lloer, to the mountain lake of Ffynnon Lloer then climbing up the slope to the summit.Like most of the summits in the southern Carneddau, it has a flat, boulder-strewn summit plateau. Immediately to the north lie the crags of Ysgolion Duon, well known to climbers.The origin of its name, which translates as Dafydd's (or David's) cairn, like that of its neighbouring peak, Carnedd Llewelyn (Llywelyn's cairn), are named after Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the last independent prince of Wales, and his younger brother, Dafydd ap Gruffudd. The nearby peak Carnedd Lladron, commonly known as Carnedd Uchaf, has now been renamed by O.S. Carnedd Gwenllian in memory of Llywelyn's daughter Lady Gwenllian. Dafydd was captured at Nanhysglain, near Bera Mawr, on 21 June 1283; taken to Shrewsbury, he was hanged, drawn and quartered."
Carnedd Llechwedd-llyfn,"Carnedd Llechwedd-llyfn is a subsidiary summit of Carnedd y Filiast on the border of Snowdonia National Park in Llandderfel, in Gwynedd.   The northern slopes of the peak lie in Ysbyty Ifan, in Conwy.  It is part of the Arenig mountain range, and rises from the shore of Llyn Celyn.It is also a peak in an area of moorland known as the Migneint. The views of northern Snowdonia are extensive. Arenig Fach, Arenig Fawr and Waun Garnedd y Filiast can also be seen.  The summit is marked by a small cairn next to a fence which runs across this boggy summit."
Carnedd Llewelyn,"Carnedd Llewelyn, usually spelt Carnedd Llywelyn in Welsh, is a mountain massif in the Carneddau range in Snowdonia, north-west Wales. It is the highest point of the Carneddau and the second highest peak by relative height in Wales, 49th in the British Isles and lies on the border between Gwynedd and Conwy."
Carnedd y Ddelw,"Carnedd y Ddelw is a summit in the Carneddau mountains in north Wales, north-east of Foel-fras. It is the Nuttall top of Drum (Wales).Its eastern slopes are drained by the Afon Tafolog, a tributary of Afon Roe that flows through the village of Rowen before joining the River Conwy. It is also the final top on Carnedd Llewelyn's long northern spur. To the north-west is Tal y Fan, the most northerly 2000 foot tall mountain in the Carneddau and Wales. The summit has two large shelter cairns, hollowed out from a large Bronze Age burial cairn."

Castell y Gwynt,"Castell y Gwynt is a top of Glyder Fach in Snowdonia, north-west Wales. It has the merit of being the only 3000 ft Welsh summit classed as only a Nuttall, hence it is not included in the Welsh 3000s. It has a prominence of 15.7 m (51.5 ft), and was only included on the Nuttall's list after re-surveying in 2007. The top is more famous as a feature than a summit.""Castell y Gwynt"" and the ""Cantilever Stone"" featured in Walt Disney's Dragonslayer."
Cefn Gwyntog,"Cefn Gwyntog is a top of Cyrniau Nod in north east Wales. It forms a part of the Berwyn range known as the Hirnantau. Its summit lies just outside the Snowdonia National Park. The views from the summit are extensive, if unremarkable due to the featureless, flat moorland surroundings. LLyn Efyrnwy (Lake Vyrnwy) can be seen below.  The summit is marked by a small cairn surrounded by peat bog and knee deep heather. Cefn Gwyntog is renowned as one of the hardest summits in Wales to reach, due to its remoteness and hard walking terrain."

Cnicht,"A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a head of state (including the pope) or representative for service to the monarch, the church or the country, especially in a military capacity. Knighthood finds origins in the Greek hippeis and hoplite (ἱππεῖς) and Roman eques  and centurion of classical antiquity.In the Early Middle Ages in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as an elite fighter or a bodyguard for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Knighthood in the Middle Ages was closely linked with horsemanship (and especially the joust) from its origins in the 12th century until its final flowering as a fashion among the high nobility in the Duchy of Burgundy in the 15th century. This linkage is reflected in the etymology of chivalry, cavalier and related terms. In that sense, the special prestige accorded to mounted warriors in Christendom finds a parallel in the furusiyya in the Islamic world. The Crusades brought various military orders of knights to the forefront of defending Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land.In the Late Middle Ages, new methods of warfare began to render classical knights in armour obsolete, but the titles remained in many countries. Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I is often referred to as the ""last knight"" in this regard. The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, particularly the literary cycles known as the Matter of France, relating to the legendary companions of Charlemagne and his men-at-arms, the paladins, and the Matter of Britain, relating to the legend of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.Today, a number of orders of knighthood continue to exist in Christian Churches, as well as in several historically Christian countries and their former territories, such as the Roman Catholic Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the Protestant Order of Saint John, as well as the English Order of the Garter, the Swedish Royal Order of the Seraphim, and the Order of St. Olav. There are also dynastic orders like the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the British Empire and the Order of St. George. In modern times these are orders centered around charity and civic service, and are no longer military orders. Each of these orders has its own criteria for eligibility, but knighthood is generally granted by a head of state, monarch, or prelate to selected persons to recognise some meritorious achievement, as in the British honours system, often for service to the Church or country. The modern female equivalent in the English language is Dame. Knighthoods and damehoods are traditionally regarded as being one of the most prestigious awards people can obtain."

Craig Cerrig-gleisiad,"Craig Cerrig-gleisiad is a subsidiary summit of Fan Fawr in the Fforest Fawr section of the Brecon Beacons National Park, South Wales. It makes up half of the Craig Cerrig-gleisiad and Fan Frynych National Nature Reserve with its sister peak Fan Frynych.The summit is marked by a pile of stones, and sits on the edge of steep north facing cliffs which provide one of the few habitats for Arctic–alpine plants this far south in the British Isles. To the south-west is Fan Llia."
Craig Cwm Amarch,"Craig Cwm Amarch is not synonymous with Craig y Cau but names the headwall of Cwm Amarch on Cadair Idris in the Snowdonia National Park, in Gwynedd, north-west Wales.There seems to be some confusion over naming by people who are not local. 'Craig Cwm Amarch' refers to the crags heading Cwm Amarch, which impinge from the south into the ridge of Mynydd Pencoed, a spur of the Cadair Idris range. The eastern end of Mynydd Pencoed overlooking Llyn Cau is known as Craig y Cau. (Daear Fawr, the ‘large ground’, may refer to an area of the Pencoed ridge. Mountain slopes in Wales are commonly named after the farms to whom the grazing belonged, hence Mynydd Pencoed is named after the farm (its buildings now derelict) at its western foot."
Craig Cwm Silyn,"Craig Cwm Silyn is a mountain in Snowdonia, North Wales which forms the highest point on the celebrated Nantlle Ridge.The steep northern face is popular with climbers. To the west the Nantlle Ridge continues over Garnedd Goch and ends at Mynydd Graig Goch. To the east the Ridge dips down to 515m before rising up to Mynydd Tal-y-mignedd, Trum y Ddysgl, Mynydd Drws-y-coed and ending at Y Garn in Nantlle. The views are extensive offering a 360 degree panorama."
Craig Eigiau,"Craig Eigiau is a top of Foel Grach in the Carneddau range in Snowdonia, North Wales, Wales.It is located on a broad ridge extending eastwards from Foel Grach, leading to a large peaty plateau, Gledrfordd, which ends with the cliffs of Craig Eigiau. The summit consists of a large rocky outcrop. Good views of Garnedd Uchaf, Foel-fras, Carnedd Llewelyn, Pen yr Helgi Du, Pen Llithrig y Wrach, Creigiau Gleision and Pen y Castell are observed."
Craiglwyn,"Craiglwyn is a top of Creigiau Gleision in Snowdonia, Wales, near Capel Curig. It lies at the south end of the Creigiau Gleision ridge, and offers good views of Carnedd Dafydd, Pen yr Helgi Du, Pen Llithrig y Wrach, Gallt yr Ogof, Tryfan and Moel Siabod."
Craig-y-llyn,"Craig y Llyn (Welsh, 'rock/cliff of the lake') is a mountain situated to the south of the village of Rhigos in the Cynon Valley on the south side of the upper Vale of Neath and north of the Rhondda Valleys in South Wales; it is the highest point in the traditional county of Glamorgan (Morgannwg), and the South Wales Valleys."
Craigysgafn,"Craigysgafn is a rocky ridge and a top of Moelwyn Mawr that leads south from Moelwyn Mawr to Moelwyn Bach in Snowdonia, North Wales. It has several gullies which lead directly down to the scree slopes above Llyn Stwlan. Some scrambling is needed in places."
Creigiau Gleision,"Creigiau Gleision is a mountain in Snowdonia, Wales, near Capel Curig. It is the easternmost of the high Carneddau and is separated from the others by Llyn Cowlyd. Directly across this reservoir from Creigiau Gleision is Pen Llithrig y Wrach. To the north-east it runs into the broad ridge of Cefn Cyfarwydd.Creigiau Gleision affords splendid views in all directions, including northwards to the coast, and down the Ogwen Valley and Dyffryn Mymbyr towards Snowdon.In fact the mountain has three peaks, hence perhaps its plural name. The most southerly peak is the highest, at 678 metres (2,224 ft), and the O.S. map also marks the northerly peak (some ½ mile distant) at 634 metres (2,080 ft).  Between these two lie a middle peak, of a height between the outer two, but cairnless and unmarked on the O.S. map.Colin Adams, author of The Mountain Walker's Guide to Wales (Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, 2002), has reached the summit of Creigiau Gleision over 450 times. He claims that on many occasions he encountered a ghost there who has spoken to him, and although he makes no reference to this in his book, he wrote about it in 1999."
Creigiau Gleision North Top,"Creigiau Gleision North Top is a mountain in Snowdonia, Wales, near Capel Curig. It is a significant top on the Creigiau Gleision ridge, topping the north end of its crest. Views of Carnedd Llewelyn are better from this summit compared to the main Creigiau Gleision summit, due to less shielding from Pen Llithrig y Wrach."
Crib Goch,"Crib Goch is described as a ""knife-edged"" arête in the Snowdonia National Park in Gwynedd, Wales. The name means ""red ridge"" in the Welsh language.The highest point on the arête is 923 metres (3,028 ft) above sea level. All routes which tackle Crib Goch are considered mountaineering routes in winter or scrambles in summer—meaning that they must cross ""graded territory"" as defined in Steve Ashton's Scrambles in Snowdonia. The easiest of these lines (the ‘bad step’ part of the route) is given a scrambling grade of Grade 1 (the most difficult being Grade 3—routes more difficult than Grade 3 are considered rock climbs)."
Crib y Ddysgl,"Garnedd Ugain, often referred to as ""Crib-y-Ddysgl"", is a pyramidal mountain in Wales that forms part of the Snowdon Massif. It is the second-highest peak in Wales, and lies just under one kilometre north of the summit of Snowdon itself.It is part of the Snowdon Horseshoe route, being linked to Crib Goch via the col at Bwlch Coch, and to Snowdon summit via the col at Bwlch Glas. It is also linked to Cwm Glas to the northeast via a steep arete called Clogwyn y Person, which joins the main Crib y Ddysgl ridge about 500 metres (1,600 feet) east of the summit."

Crib-y-rhiw,"Crib-y-rhiw is a top of Y Llethr and a ridge in the Rhinogydd of Snowdonia, north Wales. The summit straddles a thin ridge connecting Y Llethr to Diffwys."
Cyfrwy,"Cyfrwy is a subsidiary summit of Cadair Idris in the Snowdonia National Park, in Gwynedd, northwest Wales. It lies to the west of Cadair Idris and is often climbed with Cadair Idris by taking the Pony Path.The summit is bare and rocky and marked with a cairn. The north and east face has large cliffs. A rock climb/extreme scramble known as the Cyfrwy Arete is found here. This arete is very steep and rope and rock climbing skills will be needed.  To the west is Tyrrau Mawr and Craig-y-llyn, while to the south is Craig Cwm Amarch."
Cyrniau Nod,"Cyrniau Nod is a mountain summit in north east Wales. It is a former Marilyn, the Marilyn summit now being the nearby Foel Cedig. Its summit has the Snowdonia National Park boundary running through it. A number of rivers and streams rise from near the mountain including Afon Tanat, Afon Cedig and Nant Ystrad-y-Groes.The views from the summit are extensive, if unremarkable due to the featureless, flat moorland surroundings.  The summit is marked by a small cairn surrounded by peat bog.Walking on Cyrniau Nod and its tops is made easier by a track that passes close to every top except Cefn Gwyntog.  Otherwise, the walking would be tough indeed, requiring tiresome bog crossing for miles."
Dduallt,"The Ffestiniog Railway (Welsh: Rheilffordd Ffestiniog) is a 1 ft 11+1⁄2 in (597 mm) narrow-gauge heritage railway, located in Gwynedd, Wales. It is a major tourist attraction located mainly within the Snowdonia National Park.The railway is roughly 13+1⁄2 miles (21.7 km) long and runs from the harbour at Porthmadog to the slate mining town of Blaenau Ffestiniog, travelling through forested and mountainous scenery. The line is single track throughout with four intermediate passing places. The first mile of the line out of Porthmadog runs atop an embankment called the Cob, which is the dyke of the Traeth Mawr polder.The Festiniog Railway Company, which owns the railway, is the oldest surviving railway company in the world. It also owns the Welsh Highland Railway, which was re-opened fully in 2011. The two railways share the same track gauge and meet at Porthmadog station, with occasional trains working the entire 40-mile (64 km) route from Blaenau Ffestiniog to Caernarfon."
Diffwys,"Diffwys is a mountain in Snowdonia, Wales, near Barmouth and forms part of the Rhinogydd. On the north side is an exposure of the Caerdion Syncline. It is technically a subsidiary summit of Y Llethr, missing Marilyn status by 2m. It is therefore like Rhinog Fach a sub Marilyn.The summit has a trig point. To the north is Y Llethr and Crib-y-rhiw, to the east is Y Garn, to the south is Cadair Idris, and to the west is its top Diffwys West Top."
Diffwys West Top,"Diffwys West Top is a top of Diffwys in Snowdonia, North Wales, near Barmouth and forms part of the Rhinogydd. It is a grassy summit found on the west ridge.

Drum,"The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound. There is usually a resonant head on the underside of the drum. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way. Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by the one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit."
Drygarn Fawr,"Drygarn Fawr is a mountain in the county of Powys, Wales. It is one of the highest summits in Mid Wales standing at 645 metres or 2114 feet above sea level. It lies to the south of the Elan Valley Reservoirs. Rising above the remote moorland plateau of the Cambrian Mountains, and to the west of the peaks of Radnor Forest, the summit is topped by two distinctive, large cairns. The mountain has a gentle, grassy, conical shape with a few rocks near the summit. Nearby are the summits of Gorllwyn, Y Gamriw, and Drum yr Eira all over 600m."
Elidir Fawr,"Elidir Fawr is a mountain in Snowdonia, north Wales, the northernmost peak in the Glyderau. To the north of the summit is a small lake, Marchlyn Mawr, which is the upper reservoir for Dinorwig power station, a pump-storage power station hidden inside the mountain. Water from this lake flows through huge tunnels into the lower reservoir Llyn Peris. From the north, Elidir Fawr is very prominent, and can appear to be higher than the higher mountains behind it."
Erw y Ddafad-ddu,"Erw y Ddafad-ddu is a subsidiary summit of Aran Fawddwy in southern Snowdonia, North Wales, Wales, United Kingdom. It is the third highest peak in the Aran mountain range.It is lies at the centre of the main Aran ridge, situated between Aran Fawddwy to the south and Aran Benllyn to the north. Its east ridge leads off to the summit of Foel Hafod-fynydd. The summit is rocky and is marked by a small cairn."
Esgeiriau Gwynion,"Esgeiriau Gwynion is a mountain in north Wales. It is the smallest of the three Marilyns that form the Aran range, the others being Aran Fawddwy and Glasgwm.The peak is situated to the east of Aran Fawddwy, separated by Bwlch Sirddyn, and stretches right the way round Cwn Cynllwyd towards the Berwyn range at Foel y Geifr. The tops are all boggy in character, all rising from a wild, peat bog plateau. A road penetrates the plateau at Bwlch y Groes."
Fan Brycheiniog,"Fan Brycheiniog is the highest peak at a height of 802.5 metres (2,633 ft) (above sea level) in the Black Mountain (Y Mynydd Du) region of the Brecon Beacons National Park in southern Wales. There is a trig point at the peak and on the edge of the escarpment, and nearby, a stone shelter with an inner seat. It lies just inside the historic county of Brecknockshire (now part of the Powys council area) which gives the mountain its Welsh name. A subsidiary top (Fan Foel), less than a kilometre from the summit along the ridge to the northwest, is the highest point (county top) of the neighboring county of Carmarthenshire. Fan Brycheiniog is also within the Fforest Fawr Geopark designated in 2005 in recognition of the area's geological heritage. The views of the moorland and open country to the north are spectacular when the weather is clear, and reveals the isolation of the range, especially when compared with the more popular Pen y Fan range to the east."
Fan Fawr,"Fan Fawr (Welsh 'great peak') is a mountain in the Fforest Fawr section of the Brecon Beacons National Park, in Powys, Wales and over 734 m (2,408 ft) high. The summit overlooks the steep eastern face and is marked by a cairn. Unusually, the trig point on this hill does not sit at the summit but 600 m to the south-west on a subsidiary spur. The hill is drained to the west by streams flowing into the Afon Dringarth and to the east by streams draining into the Taf Fawr. The Dringarth is dammed to the west to form Ystradfellte Reservoir as is the Taf Fawr east of the hill to form Beacons Reservoir. To the north-east water flows into the Afon Tarell, a tributary of the River Usk whilst to the south the headwaters of the Afon y Waun conduct water to the Afon Hepste and eventually to the River Neath."

It is a subsidiary summit of Fan Brycheiniog. It falls within the county of Powys and is also a part of the traditional area of Fforest Fawr. Its Welsh name means ""long peak"", a fitting description, particularly if seen from the east when its steep eastern face is seen to advantage. It is about 2.5 miles or 4 km long and faces east. Its summit is 2490 feet (about 760m) above sea level. Fan Hir is separated from its higher neighbour to the north-west, Fan Brycheiniog (2633 feet or 802 metres) by a col known as Bwlch Giedd, where a path rises from Llyn y Fan Fawr via a stone staircase.The hill is drained to east and north by streams which make their way into the River Tawe."
Fan Llia,"Fan Llia is a subsidiary summit of Fan Fawr in the Fforest Fawr section of the Brecon Beacons National Park, Wales. In common with other peaks in the Fforest Fawr uplands it lies within the county of Powys.The hill has the form of a broad ridge aligned south-south-west to north-north-east peaking at an altitude of 632 m. It has a subsidiary top to the north which is known as Fan Dringarth and which attains a height of 617 m. Its broad northern ridge is eventually truncated by the cliffs of Craig Cwm-du.A number of features of archaeological interest are to be found on its flanks including several house platforms."
Fan Nedd,"Fan Nedd is a mountain in the Fforest Fawr area of the Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales.  In common with the rest of the Fforest Fawr uplands it is within the county of Powys.The hill is in the form of a broad flat-topped ridge whose summit lies at 663 m (2175 ft) and is crowned by a trig point. Its southern ridge is the least steep whereas its northern aspect is steep and craggy, having hosted a small glacier in the last ice age.A prominent modern cairn marks the northern end of the plateau whilst a couple of ancient cairns are to be found on its eastern slopes.  The hill is drained to the west by a number of streams running into the Nedd Fechan river whilst to the east, rainwater spills into the upper reaches of the Afon Llia. Both ultimately drain via the River Neath to the sea at Swansea Bay.  Its northern face overlooks the deep glacial hollow of Blaen Senni drained by the Afon Senni, a tributary of the River Usk. The hill presumably takes its name from that of the river."
Fan y Big,"Fan y Big (Welsh: Welsh pronunciation: [van ə ˈbiːg]) is a subsidiary summit of Waun Rydd in the Brecon Beacons National Park, in southern Powys, Wales. It is 716.6 m (2,351 ft) high and is often hiked as part of the Horseshoe Walk, a traverse of the four main peaks in the Brecon Beacons."

Foel y Geifr,"Foel y Geifr is a subsidiary summit of Esgeiriau Gwynion, and included in a group of hills known as the Hirnantau. These hills rise from the south east shores of Llyn Tegid. Confusion arises when trying to establish to which mountain range these belong to. Since, Foel y Geifr forms part of the Hirnant horseshoe, many consider it to be a Berwyn peak. However, geographically it belongs to the Aran Fawddwy group, its parent peak being Esgeiriau Gwynion. It is the eastern outpost of the Arans.The summit is grassy and has a trig point, while the terrain surrounding the summit is heathery and boggy. The summit is the highest in a ridge that forms the western backwall of Cwm Hirnant. Two other summit lie along the ridge: Trum y Gwragedd and the Hewitt Foel Goch (Hirnant). To the south-west lies Moel y Cerrig Duon, to the east lies Pen y Boncyn Trefeilw and Cyrniau Nod."
Foel-fras,"Foel-fras (944 m) is a mountain in the Carneddau range, about 10 km east of Bethesda in North Wales. It lies on the border between the counties of Gwynedd and Conwy. With a summit elevation of 944 m it is officially the eleventh-highest summit in Wales.Foel-fras is located at the northern end of the main ridge of the Carneddau, between Drum to the north and Foel Grach to the south, with the subsidiary summit of Garnedd Uchaf (925 m) between it and Foel Grach. Due south and 400 m below lies the reservoir of Llyn Dulyn, while the smaller reservoir of Llyn Anafon lies to the north.Because of its position, it is the first of the Welsh 3000s reached when doing this walk from the northern end. It can be climbed by driving up the small road signposted ""Aber Falls"" in the village of Abergwyngregyn, passing the car park for the falls and continuing to a small car park at the end of the road. From there it is possible to take the track bearing left, later turning right to the summit of Drum and continuing along the ridge, or to take the track leading straight on to Llyn Anafon and then climbing up to the ridge between Drum and Foel Fras. An alternate route up the mountain is to start at the Western end of the Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen pass and take the steep track up the side of Drosgyl, following the fence line all the way to where the ground levels off. Here the views open up and the fence changes direction, running off at almost a right angle to the Southeast (left). From here, follow a small track Southwest until it intersects the larger track previously mentioned - marked by a small quartz-peppered cairn - which will lead you to Drum. From Drum the walk to the summit of Foel Fras is simply parallel to the fence line, which changes into a dry stone wall as you are nearing the summit. Car parking is available at the Eastern end of the pass.The summit plateau has some ornithological interest in that it is one of the best places in Wales to observe dotterel on their spring and less frequent autumn migration.Foel Fras can also be reached from Llanfairfechan, an equally as beautiful route as that from Aber Falls. Follow the road up through the village of Llanfairfechan until Terrace Walk, take the path from Terrace Walk that takes you past Hengae Farm, then follow the path that can take you to the summit of Garreg Fawr, Drum, Foel Fras and more."
Foel-goch,"Foel-goch is a mountain in Snowdonia, north-west Wales, and forms part of the Glyderau range, in Gwynedd.

Gallt y Daren,"Gallt y Daren is a peak in the southern half of the Snowdonia National Park in Gwynedd, North Wales, and forms part of the Arenig mountain range. It is a top of Moel Llyfnant, and is twin peaked. It lies to the west of Moel Llyfnant.The summit itself is situated on a rocky outcrop offering extensive views of the Rhinogs and Snowdonia to the north.The peak is often known as Foel Boeth. However, the Nuttall list includes both the twin tops resulting in the higher top being called Gallt y Daren and the lower top being called Foel Boeth (616m). It lies to the west of Moel Llyfnant."
Gallt y Wenallt,"Gallt y Wenallt is a subsidiary summit of Y Lliwedd in Snowdonia National Park, north Wales. It lies at the end of the north ridge.

Garnedd Uchaf,"Carnedd Gwenllian (named Y Garnedd Uchaf before 2009) is a minor summit of the Carneddau range in Snowdonia, Wales, and included in the Welsh 3000s.  From the summit, distant views to the north can extend as far as Ireland and the Isle of Man, and to the South as far as the Berwyn Ranges.It lies between Foel Fras and Foel Grach, but is not always included in the Welsh 3000s, as its summit rises only slightly above the ridge. However, it is classed as a Hewitt. Its slopes, like all those in the northern Carneddau, are largely grassy, although they are steep.  The slopes can receive significant accumulations of snow-drifts during blizzards in winter.  In the past, snow beds have survived on the mountain as far as June.  The annual average temperature on Y Garnedd Uchaf is relatively cold, ranging between 4-5 degrees Celsius.For some years there was a campaign by the Princess Gwenllian Society to have the name of this peak changed from Y Garnedd Uchaf to Carnedd Gwenllian. Gwenllian of Wales (1282–1337) was the only daughter of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. After her father's death, she was held in a nunnery at Sempringham in Lincolnshire until she died. On 26 September 2009 the summit was officially renamed Carnedd Gwenllian, and the Ordnance Survey has agreed to use the dual name Carnedd Uchaf/Carnedd Gwenllian on its maps from 2010 onwards."

Traditionally, the top of Maen Du (674 metres (2,211 ft) at SH823152) was regarded as Maesglase's summit. However, more recent surveys suggest that the top of Craig Rhiw-erch (c 676 metres (2,218 ft) at SH817150, some 600 metres (2,000 ft) to the west) is higher. A recent survey puts it at 678.5 metres (2,226 ft). The geomorphology of these mountains is classical U-shaped glacial valleys with textbook examples of hanging valleys and intersecting valleys. The eastern slopes are devoted to sheep farming whilst the western slopes are intensively forested.Above the semi-improved grassland is some bracken but much of the higher ground is covered in typical Calluna / Erica communities interspersed with large areas of Juncus, Carex and Sphagnum bogs. The tops of Cribin Fawr are flat expanses of peat-hags. On the eastern flanks Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) grows in abundance with Cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) common on the highest ground.Half a mile to the west of the peak of Cribin Fawr at a high point of 659 metres (2,162 ft) is a stone boundary marker dated 1861 and inscribed CCC and bearing a benchmark. Maesglase waterfall has a total height of 160 metres (520 ft).To the south lie the parallel ridges leading to Mynydd Dolgoed and Mynydd Gartheiniog.The site is the location of the Welsh-language novel O! Tyn y Gorchudd! by Angharad Price."

Pen yr Allt Uchaf,"Pen yr Allt Uchaf is a subsidiary summit of Aran Fawddwy in the south of the Snowdonia National Park in Gwynedd, Wales. The summit is the highest point on a ridge branching off to the west of Aran Fawddwy's south ridge. The summit is marked by a small cairn, and offers bird-eyes views of Cwm Cywarch. Close views of the steep south faces of Glasgwm, Gwaun y Llwyni and Aran Fawddwy are observed."
Pen yr Helgi Du,"Pen yr Helgi Du (Head or Hill of the Black Hound) is a mountain peak in the eastern part of the Carneddau in Snowdonia, North Wales.It lies on the south-eastern flanks of Carnedd Llewelyn, and is linked to Carnedd Llewelyn over the col of Bwlch Eryl Farchog, a knife-edge ridge over the cliffs of Craig Yr Ysfa.From here the walker can drop down into Cwm Eigiau to the east or to the Ffynnon Llugwy reservoir to the south. Continuing over Pen yr Helgi Du to the east you will reach the even more beautifully named Pen Llithrig y Wrach (the slippery peak of the witch)."
Pen yr Ole Wen,"Pen yr Ole Wen is the seventh highest mountain in Snowdonia and in Wales. It is the most southerly of the Carneddau range.The mountain lies to the north of Idwal Cottage youth hostel on the A5 road, from where it has a pyramidal appearance. It may be climbed from the hostel by a path that leads directly up the south west ""corner"", climbing 675 m in about 1.5 km (i.e. an average gradient of nearly 1 in 2). A slightly easier ascent involves starting from Tal-y-Llyn Ogwen, about a mile north-east from the hostel, following the stream until nearing the outflow from the mountain lake Ffynnon Lloer and then branching left to take the path up the ridge.For many years the mountain's name was translated as ""Head of the White Light"", the interpretation of which was a mystery. However in 2004 Professor Hywel Wyn Owen at the Place-Name Research Centre at Bangor University in Bangor, Gwynedd resolved the matter saying that Ole comes from Goleddf, which means slope or hillside, making the correct English translation: ""Head of the White Slope"".Pen yr Ole Wen is often climbed as part of a longer route on the Carneddau range. It is the same height as England's highest peak, Scafell Pike.The mountain's average temperature hovers around 5 degrees Celsius."

This ridge has a peat bog covering, with the heather being very deep. No well trodden paths have developed here and the summit is seldom visited. The summit is marked by a pile of stones and offers views of Cwm Rhiwarth. The south ridge continues towards the summit of Glan-hafon, which at 608m is under 2000 ft."
Pumlumon Fach,"Pumlumon Fach is a top of Pen Pumlumon Fawr on the Plynlimon massif, a part of the Cambrian Mountains in the county of Ceredigion, Wales. It lies on small ridge heading north-west from the summit of Pen Pumlumon Fawr.The summit is marked by small cairn, and overlooks the Nant-y-moch Reservoir to the north and Llyn Llygad Rheidiol to the east. The views also include the smaller summits of Drosgol (550m) and Banc Llechwedd-mawr (560m) and Cwm Hyddgen, a hide out of Owain Glyndŵr and his army."
Pumlumon Fawr,"Pumlumon (historically anglicised in various ways including Plynlimon, Plinlimon and Plinlimmon) is the highest point of the Cambrian Mountains in Wales (taking a restricted definition of the Cambrian Mountains, excluding Snowdonia, the Berwyns and the Brecon Beacons), and the highest point in Mid Wales. It is a massif that dominates the surrounding countryside and is the highest point (county top) of Ceredigion (both the modern council area, and the historic county, also known as Cardiganshire).The highest point of the massif itself is Pen Pumlumon Fawr, which is 752 metres (2,467 ft) above ordnance datum. Its other important peaks are Pen Pumlumon Arwystli, Y Garn, Pen Pumlumon Llygad-bychan and Pumlumon Fach.The longest river in Britain, the River Severn, has its source on the mountain, as do the rivers Wye and Rheidol.Folklore says there is a sleeping giant in Pumlumon."
Rhinog Fach,"Rhinog Fach is a mountain in Snowdonia, North Wales and forms part of the Rhinogydd. Technically, Rhinog Fach is a subsidiary summit of Y Llethr, but is a Marilyn. To the north lies its higher cousin Rhinog Fawr, separated by the shapely pass of Blwch Drws Ardudwy.Although shorter than the highest mountain in the Rhinog range, Y Llethr, it is often regarded as the true 'king of the Rhinogydd' due to its spectacular rocky peak. Unlike Fach, Y Llethr's peak is grassy and unremarkable."
Rhinog Fawr,"Rhinog Fawr is a mountain in Snowdonia, North Wales and forms part of the Rhinogydd range. It is the third highest summit of the Rhinogydd, losing out to Y Llethr and Diffwys respectively. Its smaller cousin Rhinog Fach lies to the south, separated by the pass of Bwlch Drws Ardudwy, while its other neighbour, Moel Ysgyfarnogod lies to the north.In common with most of the range, the terrain is characterised by hard sedimentary rock covered with heather, making progress on foot difficult. At 510m, nestled in crags, lies Llyn Du, a small tarn beneath the summit. The ascent is most easily made from the north-east or north-west, via the Roman Steps pass."
Rhobell Fawr,"Rhobell Fawr is the site of an ancient volcano that was active during the Early Ordovician period in the Arenig range within the Snowdonia National Park. Despite its modest height of 734 m (2,408 feet), it is a mountain with views of higher peaks all around, including the north face of Cadair Idris and distant Snowdon.

Waun Camddwr,"Waun Camddwr is a top of Aran Fawddwy in the south of the Snowdonia National Park in Gwynedd, Wales. It is the highest point on a wide boggy area between the summits of Aran Fawddwy and Glasgwm. It was surveyed after the first Nuttall list was compiled, and found to have just enough prominence to be included. The summit is a rocky outcrop amid an area of heather, long grass and peat bog. Gwaun y Llwyni rises to the south of the summit."
Waun Fach,"Waun Fach is, with a summit height of 811 metres (2,661 ft), the highest mountain in the Black Mountains in south-eastern Wales.

Foel Goch (Arenigs), Carnedd Llechwedd-llyfn and Mwdwl-eithin can be seen.The top was not included in the Nuttall's original list. However, in 1999 it was surveyed to have the following re-ascent 15.1295 m (49 ft 7.5in). Controversy arose due to it not being quite 50 ft. Some walkers choose only to include it in a Metric list along with 600–608 m sub Hewitt summits. However, most walkers regard it as a full Nuttall by now since it rounds up to 50 ft."
Waun Lefrith,"Waun Lefrith is a top of Picws Du and is also the westernmost of the Carmarthen Fans or Bannau Sir Gaer, a group of peaks within the Black Mountain (Y Mynydd Du) of the Brecon Beacons National Park (Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog).

Y Garn (Glyders),"Glyder Fawr is a mountain in Snowdonia, Wales, the highest peak in the Glyderau range at just over 1,000 metres, having had its height recalculated in 2010 using GPS. It is the fifth-highest mountain in Wales and has several walking and scrambling routes leading to its summit. According to Sir Ifor Williams, the word ""Glyder"" derives from the Welsh word ""Gludair"", meaning a heap of stones."
Y Garn (Moel Hebog),"Moel Hebog (Welsh  for Bare Hill of the Hawk) is a mountain in Snowdonia, north Wales which dominates the view west from the village of Beddgelert. It gives name to a whole range of peaks in the north-western corner of Snowdonia, which include the Nantlle Ridge and Mynydd Mawr.From that side, Moel Hebog has a rocky face with a distinctive pointed summit, although from other sides, it appears more rounded. The exposed rock means that it is often visited by students of geology. Much of the mountain consists of welded, fiamme rich rhyolitic tuff.It is often climbed from Beddgelert and it can be combined with the nearby mountains of Moel yr Ogof and Moel Lefn for a longer walk. This route, however, does involve some easy scrambling.On Moel yr Ogof can be found Owain Glyndŵr's Cave. The view of Moel Hebog and Llyn Gwynant from the north near Snowdon is one of the most photographed in Snowdonia.A late Bronze Age shield was found in a bog near Moel Hebog in 1784.

Y Garn (Rhinogs),"The Rhinogydd (a Welsh plural form, often anglicised as Rhinogs and also known by the alternative Welsh plural Rhinogau) are a range of mountains located east of Harlech in North Wales. The name Rhinogydd derives from the names of two of the more famous peaks, Rhinog Fawr and Rhinog Fach, although the greatest elevation in the range is reached by Y Llethr, 756 m (2,480 feet).Foel Penolau, the northernmost summit of the range, was promoted to a Hewitt in 2018 due to a new survey.The Rhinogydd are notably rocky and heather-clad towards the northern end of the range, especially around Rhinog Fawr, Rhinog Fach and towards Moel Ysgyfarnogod. The southern end, around Y Llethr, Diffwys and the Ysgethin Valley has a softer, grassy character.A population of feral goats are in the range. Over 30 km² are protected as a Special Area of Conservation and a National Nature Reserve."

Its summit has the Snowdonia National Park boundary located just to the east of it.The views from the summit are extensive, if unremarkable due to the featureless, flat moorland surroundings.  The summit is marked by a post. To the north, the ridge continues to Foel Cwm Sian Llwyd."
Y Gyrn,"Y Gyrn is a top of Pen y Fan in South Wales, situated in the Brecon Beacons National Park. Tommy Jones' Obelisk is found in between the summit and Corn Du.The summit is a boggy mound overlooking the A470 and the Storey Arms. It is marked by a pile of stones."
Y Llethr,"Y Llethr is the highest mountain in the Rhinogydd range of Snowdonia, in north Wales. The summit consists of a flat grassy top marked only by a small cairn. The summit is more in keeping with its southern flanks than its rugged northern approach.The shortest route to the summit goes from the valley of Cwm Nantcol in the west, either directly or via Bwlch Drws Ardudwy and over the mountain of Rhinog Fach. To the south lies  the mountain of Diffwys, to the south-east lies the mountain of Y Garn, to the north lies Rhinog Fach and to the west lies the hill of Moelfre."
Y Lliwedd,None
Y Lliwedd East Top,"Y Lliwedd East Peak is the twin top of Y Lliwedd in the Snowdonia National Park, North Wales. It is only 5 metres shorter than the main summit of Y Lliwedd.The summit marked by a small pile of stones, the views being similar to Y Lliwedd, except for Gallt y Wenallt being in view."
Yr Aran,"Yr Aran is a mountain peak on a ridge radiating south from Snowdon, Wales' highest mountain, with beautiful views of the summit of Snowdon, Moel Hebog and the Nantlle Ridge.Although no paths are marked on maps, the ascent is easily made as a detour from the Rhyd Ddu path or the Watkin Path up Snowdon."
Yr Elen,"Yr Elen is a mountain in the Carneddau range in Snowdonia, Wales. It is the ninth highest mountain in Snowdonia.  The average annual temperature of the peak is around 4 °C (39 °F). It lies on a short ridge running north-northwest off the main northeast-to-southwest ridge of the Carneddau, just over one kilometre from Carnedd Llewelyn. It is usually climbed from the main ridge of the Carneddau, as it is only a short walk from Carnedd Llywelyn. It can also be climbed from Gerlan, near Bethesda, following Afon Llafar then heading up the slopes of Yr Elen, but this involves walking through wet valleys and a number of rivers that are difficult to cross. In drier times, ascent can be made via the crossing of Afon Caseg and then up the ""front edge"" of the peak. The views from this point north-west, over to Bangor and Anglesey, are stunning on a clear day, especially with a summer's sunset. This is well worth the arduous ascent.The etymology of the name is unclear, with the personal name ""Helen"" or ""Eleanor"" being one possibility, perhaps after  Eleanor de Montfort (d. 1282), Princess of Wales and wife of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd.  Another is the leech (from soft mutation of Welsh gelen, leech), perhaps in reference to the way in which Yr Elen appears to be attached to the side of the remaining Carneddau."
