Labour Party,"The Labour Party is a political party in the United Kingdom that has been described as an alliance of social democrats, democratic socialists and trade unionists. The Labour Party sits on the centre-left of the political spectrum. In all general elections since 1922, Labour has been either the governing party or the Official Opposition. There have been six Labour prime ministers and thirteen Labour ministries.The party was founded in 1900, having grown out of the trade union movement and socialist parties of the 19th century. It overtook the Liberal Party to become the main opposition to the Conservative Party in the early 1920s, forming two minority governments under Ramsay MacDonald in the 1920s and early 1930s. Labour served in the wartime coalition of 1940–1945, after which Clement Attlee's Labour government established the National Health Service and expanded the welfare state from 1945 to 1951. Under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, Labour again governed from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1979. In the 1990s, Tony Blair took Labour to the centre as part of his New Labour project which governed under Blair and then Gordon Brown from 1997 to 2010.The Labour Party currently forms the Official Opposition in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, having won the second-largest number of seats in the 2019 general election. The leader of the party and leader of the opposition is Keir Starmer. Labour is the largest party in the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), being the only party in the current Welsh government. The party is the third-largest in the Scottish Parliament, behind the Scottish National Party and the Scottish Conservatives. Labour is a member of the Party of European Socialists and Progressive Alliance, and holds observer status in the Socialist International. The party includes semi-autonomous London, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish branches, however it supports the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in Northern Ireland, while still organising there. As of July 2021, Labour has around 430,000 registered members, one of the largest memberships of any party in Europe."

Socialist Party,"Socialist Party is the name of many different political parties around the world. All of these parties claim to uphold some form of socialism, though they may have very different interpretations of what ""socialism"" means. Statistically, most of these parties advocate either democratic socialism, social democracy or even Third Way as their ideological position. Many Socialist Parties have explicit connections to the labor movement and trade unions. See also Socialist International, list of democratic socialist parties and organizations and list of social democratic parties. A number of affiliates of the Trotskyist International Socialist Alternative also use the name ""Socialist Party"".This list only includes parties that use the exact name ""Socialist Party"" for themselves, sometimes alongside the name of the country in which they operate. The list does not include political parties that use the word ""Socialist"" in addition to one or more other political adjectives in their names. For example, the numerous parties using the name ""Socialist Workers' Party"" are not included."

Sinn F?in,"Sinn Féin ( shin FAYN, Irish: [ˌʃiːn̠ʲ ˈfʲeːnʲ]; English: ""[We] Ourselves"") is an Irish republican and democratic socialist political party active throughout both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.The original Sinn Féin organisation was founded in 1905 by Arthur Griffith, but has split substantially on a number of occasions since then, notably giving rise in the aftermath of the Irish Civil War to the two traditionally dominant parties of Irish politics: Fianna Fáil, and Cumann na nGaedheal (which became Fine Gael). The current Sinn Féin party took its form in 1970 after another split (with the other faction eventually becoming the Workers' Party of Ireland) and was historically associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). Mary Lou McDonald became party president in February 2018.Sinn Féin is one of the two largest parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly, winning one fewer seat than the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) at the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election. In that assembly it is the largest Irish nationalist party, and it holds four ministerial posts in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive as of 2020. In the UK House of Commons, Sinn Féin holds seven of Northern Ireland's 18 seats, making it the second-largest bloc after the DUP; there it follows a policy of abstentionism, refusing to sit in parliament or vote on bills. It is the third-largest party overall in the Oireachtas (the parliament of the Republic of Ireland), but in the lower house (Dáil Éireann), it is tied with Fianna Fáil for most representatives. Sinn Féin is the main opposition in the Dáil, having won the largest share of first-preference votes at the 2020 Irish general election."
Fis Nua,"Fís Nua (pronounced [ˌfʲiːʃ ˈn̪ˠuə]; English: ""New Vision"") is a minor political party in Ireland.The party was formed in June 2010, mainly by former members of the Green Party who were unhappy with that party's participation in the then coalition government with Fianna Fáil. Fís Nua intended to campaign on the issues of political transparency, environmental issues and social justice, and hoped to draw support from existing supporters of both the Greens and the Labour Party.The party was registered on 4 February 2011, and on the following day it was announced that they would run six candidates in the 2011 general election.""Fís Nua"" means ""New Vision"" in Irish. (A separate organisation called New Vision also ran candidates in the 2011 general election.)The party previously had one town councillor in Wicklow, Pat Kavanagh, who was elected as a member of the Green Party, but quit that party and ran in the 2011 election as a Fís Nua candidate. She then became an Independent politician.Fís Nua has not contested any elections since 2016, though as of June 2021, it remains a registered political party."
