Military Dictatorship,"A military dictatorship (also known as a khakistocracy) is a dictatorship in which the military exerts complete or substantial control over political authority, and the dictator is often a high-ranked military officer.The reverse situation is to have civilian control of the military."
One Party State,"A one-party state, single-party state, one-party system, or single-party system is a type of sovereign state in which only one political party has the right to form the government, usually based on the existing constitution. All other parties are either outlawed or allowed to take only a limited and controlled participation in elections. Sometimes the term de facto one-party state is used to describe a dominant-party system that, unlike the one-party state, allows (at least nominally) democratic multiparty elections, but the existing practices or balance of political power effectively prevent the opposition from winning power.The rule of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) in the Ottoman Empire following the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état is considered the first one-party state."
Republic,"A republic (from Latin  res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which ""supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives"". In republics, the country is considered a ""public matter"", not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word ""republic"" as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word ""republic"" used in the names of all states with elected governments.The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means ""public thing"", ""public matter"", or ""public affair"" and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC. This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority.Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics, or that have governments that are described as republican in nature. For instance, the United States Constitution ""guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government"". Another example was the Soviet Union, described by its undemocratic and extremely centralised government as being a federation of voluntarily united ""Soviet socialist republics"" with equal rights and ostensibly high degree of internal autonomy. The Russian Federation is similarly a state that is composed partly of several ""republics""."

Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word ""republic"" used in the names of all states with elected governments.The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means ""public thing"", ""public matter"", or ""public affair"" and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC. This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority.Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics, or that have governments that are described as republican in nature. For instance, the United States Constitution ""guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government"". Another example was the Soviet Union, described by its undemocratic and extremely centralised government as being a federation of voluntarily united ""Soviet socialist republics"" with equal rights and ostensibly high degree of internal autonomy. The Russian Federation is similarly a state that is composed partly of several ""republics""."
Military Dictatorship,"A military dictatorship (also known as a khakistocracy) is a dictatorship in which the military exerts complete or substantial control over political authority, and the dictator is often a high-ranked military officer.The reverse situation is to have civilian control of the military."
Republic,"A republic (from Latin  res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which ""supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives"". In republics, the country is considered a ""public matter"", not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word ""republic"" as part of their official names.

Colony (France),"From the 16th to the 17th centuries, the First French colonial empire stretched from a total area at its peak in 1680 to over 10,000,000 km2 (3,900,000 sq mi), the second largest empire in the world at the time behind only the Spanish Empire. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the French colonial empire was the second largest colonial empire in the world only behind the British Empire; it extended over 13,500,000 km2 (5,200,000 sq mi) of land at its height in the 1920s and 1930s. In terms of population however, on the eve of World War II, France and her colonial possessions totaled only 110 million inhabitants, compared with 330 million for British India alone.France began to establish colonies in North America, the Caribbean and India, following Spanish and Portuguese successes during the Age of Discovery, in rivalry with Britain. A series of wars with Britain during the 18th century and early 19th century, which France finally lost, almost ended its colonial ambitions in these regions, and without it what some historians term the ""first"" French colonial empire. In the 19th century, starting with the conquest of Algiers in 1830, France began to establish a new empire in Africa and Southeast Asia.The following is a list of all countries that were part of the French colonial empires in the last 500 years, either entirely or in part, either under French sovereignty or as mandate."
Monarchy,"A monarch is a head of state for life or until abdication, and therefore the head of state of a monarchy. A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the state, or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Usually a monarch either personally inherits the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as the throne or the crown) or is selected by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may proclaim themself monarch, which may be backed and legitimated through acclamation, right of conquest or a combination of means.If a young child is crowned the monarch, then a regent is often appointed to govern until the monarch reaches the requisite adult age to rule. Monarchs' actual powers vary from one monarchy to another and in different eras; on one extreme, they may be autocrats (absolute monarchy) wielding genuine sovereignty; on the other they may be ceremonial heads of state who exercise little or no direct power or only reserve powers, with actual authority vested in a parliament or other body (constitutional monarchy).A monarch can reign in multiple monarchies simultaneously. For example, the monarchy of Canada and the monarchy of the United Kingdom (as well as 14 other Commonwealth realms) are separate states, but they share the same monarch through personal union."
