It is native to western North America, from Yukon and British Columbia to California to Texas.This perennial grass grows in leafy clumps up to 175 centimeters tall. The inflorescence is a narrow panicle with branches upright or pressed parallel to the stem. The roots may extend nearly one meter deep into the soil. The grass remains green throughout much of the season, sometimes until the first snowfall.This grass occurs in many types of habitat in western North America. It is a dominant grass in a number of regions, such as shrubsteppe in Colorado and forest and woodland ecosystems in Arizona and New Mexico. In some areas, it is an indicator of climax status in sagebrush and pinyon-juniper woodland. It indicates true dry grassland in northern Alberta and pristine subalpine habitat on the Wasatch Plateau in Utah. In New Mexico it grows back quickly after wildfire. It tolerates heavy grazing, and is one of the last species to be overgrazed and one of the first to recover when overgrazing stops.Many types of livestock and wildlife feed on the grass, especially when it is immature. As the fruit of the grass develops it becomes hard and pointed and becomes stuck in the mouths and ears of animals; at this point they try to avoid feeding on it."
Achnatherum richardsonii,"Achnatherum richardsonii is a species of grass known by the common names Richardson's needlegrass, spreading needlegrass, and Canada mountain-ricegrass.

Agrostis gigantea,"Agrostis gigantea, known by its common names black bent and redtop, is a perennial grass of the Agrostis genus.It is native to Europe, but in the cooler areas of North America was widely used as a pasture grass until the 1940s. Although it has largely been replaced by soybeans and more palatable grasses, it still gets some use in poor soils. It was one of the grasses planted in areas disturbed by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. It generally does well in response to fires, due to survival of rhizomes and seeds.It can be found in open woodland, rough grassland, hedgerows, roadsides and waste ground, and as a weed on arable land.This species is similar to Agrostis stolonifera, with the key difference being that the latter has stolons.  In fact the two are sometimes treated as a single species, and it is not always clear precisely what an author means by  Agrostis alba or Agrostis stolonifera.Many internet sources describe Agrostis capillaris as being the tallest of the bent species.  However C E Hubbard describes its height as ranging from 10 to 70 cm high, whereas Agrostis gigantea is 40–120 centimetres (16–47 in). Marjorie Blamey, Richard and Alastair Fitter also describe black bent as being taller."
Agrostis scabra,"Agrostis scabra is a common species of grass known by the common names hair grass, rough bent, rough bent grass, winter bent grass, and ticklegrass. A tumbleweed, it is a bunchgrass native to Asia and much of North America, and widely known elsewhere as an introduced species."

It forms dense stands on disturbed sites, sand dunes, in wetlands and riparian habitats."
Arundinaria gigantea,"Arundinaria gigantea is a species of bamboo known as giant cane (not to be confused with Arundo donax) and river cane. It is endemic to the south-central and southeastern United States as far west as Oklahoma and Texas and as far north as New York. This species is divided into two subspecies. The subspecies tecta is sometimes treated as a species in its own right, Arundinaria tecta, and is the taxon generally called switch cane. It is very similar to the nominate subspecies (gigantea), but is often smaller and tends to grow in wetter habitats.It and other species of Arundinaria may grow in large monotypic colonies called canebrakes. Canebrakes were once a common feature of the landscape in the southeastern United States, but today it is an endangered ecosystem."
Arundinaria gigantea subsp. gigantea,"A canebrake or canebreak is a thicket of any of a variety of Arundinaria grasses: A. gigantea, A. tecta and A. appalachiana. As a bamboo, these giant grasses grow in thickets up to 24 ft tall. A. gigantea is generally found in stream valleys and ravines throughout the southeastern United States. A. tecta is a smaller stature species found on the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains. Finally, A. appalachiana is found in more upland areas at the southern end of the Appalachian mountains.Canebrakes were formerly widespread in the Southern United States but have been widely replaced by agriculture. This destruction has impacted a number of species. The survival of the Florida panther (Puma concolor subsp. coryi) has been challenged, and Bachman's warbler (Vermivora bachmanii) has gone extinct. Other species considered canebrake specialists include several butterfly species, and Swainson's warbler (Limnothlypis swainsonii). Swainson's warbler has recently been found to use pine plantations (widespread across the Southeastern United States) of a particular age, as they may provide the structural features and prey base that the species seeks.Canes can reproduce asexually and rapidly, an adaptation that allows them to persist quietly in the shade of a forest for years and rapidly take advantage of disturbance which disrupts the overstory, such as blowdowns, floods or hurricanes. When released in this way, canes can quickly reoccupy these gaps."

Calamagrostis canadensis,"Calamagrostis canadensis is a species of grass, having three or more varieties, in the family Poaceae. It is known variously by the common names of bluejoint, bluejoint reedgrass, marsh reedgrass, Canadian reedgrass, meadow pinegrass, and marsh pinegrass."
Calamovilfa longifolia,"Calamovilfa longifolia is a species of grass known by the common names prairie sandreed and sand reedgrass. It is native to North America, where it occurs from the Northwest Territories to Ontario in Canada and as far south as New Mexico and Kansas in the United States. There are two varieties, var. longifolia being widespread in the species' range and var. magna being native to the Great Lakes region.This species is a perennial grass with long, leafy rhizomes which hold the soil, forming sod. The roots may reach 3 metres (9.8 feet) deep in the soil. The stems are up to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) tall and can form colonies up to 8 m (26 ft) in diameter. Each stem has up to 12 leaves up to 76 centimetres (2.49 feet) long by 1 cm (0.39 in) wide. The leaves tend to roll up during dry conditions. The inflorescence is a panicle up to 78 cm (31 in) long. The spikelet is pale and shiny. The fruit is a caryopsis a few millimeters in length which has a ring of long hairs around its base. These help the seeds disperse on the wind. The plant may reproduce sexually via seed, but most of its reproduction is vegetative as the plant sprouts from the starchy tips of its rhizomes. Plants growing in moist, disturbed habitat and recently burned areas are most likely to produce seeds.This grass occurs in several types of habitat, including many types of grassland and prairie, pine and hardwood forest, sagebrush, and pinyon-juniper woodland, and dunes such as those on the margins of the Great Lakes. The plant grows in climates featuring hot summers, cold winters, and moderate precipitation. It is a dominant grass species in many regions, including the Nebraska Sand Hills and other sand hills, the Red River Valley, many prairies and grasslands of the Great Plains, and certain beaches along the Great Lakes, such as those at Kohler-Andrae State Park and Point Beach State Forest in Wisconsin.Though it is not one of the most palatable or nutritious grasses, this species is an important forage for livestock in sand hills regions. It begins growth earlier in the season than many other grasses. Some species of wildlife utilize it for food, such as California quail and pocket gophers. Waterfowl and black-tailed prairie dogs use it for cover.This grass is useful for stabilizing soil and preventing erosion because its robust rhizome easily holds loose, sandy soils. It can be used in revegetation efforts in disturbed habitat with sandy substrates, such as blowouts. A number of cultivars have been developed, including 'Goshen' and 'Pronghorn'. Pests of the grass include grasshoppers and the rust fungus Puccinia amphigena."
Calamagrostis montanensis,"Calamagrostis montanensis is a species of grass known by the common names plains reedgrass and prairie reedgrass. It is native to North America, where it is found across Canada from British Columbia to Manitoba and south to Colorado in the United States.This plant is a perennial grass growing a single stem, not forming a tuft or clump. It grows up to 60 centimeters tall. It has a network of thin rhizomes and roots that hold the soil, forming sod. The roots have been observed to penetrate over a meter deep in the soil. The stiff, rolled leaves are mostly located around the base of the stem and reach up to 15 centimeters long by just a few millimeters wide. The inflorescence is a narrow panicle up to 10 centimeters long. The spikelet contains one flower. The plant reproduces vegetatively by sprouting from its rhizome and sexually by its wind-dispersed seed.This grass occurs in a number of habitat types, including temperate coniferous forest, sagebrush, shrubsteppe, and several types of prairie and grassland. It is a dominant grass species in several regions in the Great Basin and Great Plains. It tolerates cold winters and hot summers. It is common in disturbed habitat. It grows in all stages of ecological succession and is a climax species in some regions, such as the Canadian mixed-grass prairie and the mountains and foothills of Montana.This is the only Calamagrostis that provides forage for grazing livestock on the northern Great Plains. It is consumed by cattle and horses, and less often by sheep. It is not a favorite forage plant for livestock because its leaves are coarse in texture."

Carex aquatilis,"Carex aquatilis is a species of sedge known as water sedge and leafy tussock sedge. It has a circumboreal distribution, occurring throughout the northern reaches of the Northern Hemisphere. It grows in many types of mountainous and arctic habitat, including temperate coniferous forest, alpine meadows, tundra, and wetlands.There are several varieties of this species, and it is somewhat variable in appearance. It produces triangular stems reaching heights between 20 cm (8 in) and 1.5 m (5 ft), and generally does not form clumps as some other sedges do. It grows from a dense rhizome network which produces a mat of fine roots thick enough to form sod, and includes aerenchyma to allow the plant to survive in low-oxygen substrates like heavy mud. The inflorescence bears a number of spikes with one leaflike bract at the base which is longer than the inflorescence itself. The fruits are glossy achenes, and although the plant occasionally reproduces by seed, most of the time it reproduces vegetatively, spreading via its rhizome.

Carex lenticularis var. dolia,"Monocotyledon species found in Montana number at least 615. The Montana Natural Heritage Program has identified a number of monocot species as Species of Concern.Monocotyledons are one of two major groups of flowering plants (or angiosperms) that are traditionally recognized, the other being dicotyledons, or dicots. Monocot seedlings typically have one cotyledon (seed-leaf), in contrast to the two cotyledons typical of dicots. Monocots have been recognized at various taxonomic ranks, and under various names (see below). The APG II system recognises a clade called ""monocots"" but does not assign it to a taxonomic rank.There are between 50,000 and 60,000 species within this group; according to IUCN there are 59,300 species. The largest family in this group (and in the flowering plants as a whole) by number of species are the orchids (family Orchidaceae), with more than 20,000 species. In agriculture the majority of the biomass produced comes from monocots. The true grasses, family Poaceae (Gramineae), are the most economically important family in this group. These include all the true grains (rice, wheat, maize, etc.), the pasture grasses, sugar cane, and the bamboos. True grasses have evolved to become highly specialised for wind pollination. Grasses produce much smaller flowers, which are gathered in highly visible plumes (inflorescences). Other economically important monocot families are the palm family (Arecaceae), banana family (Musaceae), ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and the onion family Alliaceae, which includes such ubiquitously used vegetables as onions and garlic."

This clumping erect perennial grass is native to North America, where it is widespread across most of Canada and along the western United States into California.  It is a plant of the plains as well as forested, mountainous, alpine environments.The bunchgrass reaches about half a meter in height at maximum. Its leaves are short and mostly basal. Each inflorescence is a narrow cluster of up to about ten spikelets, each spikelet holding 3 to 6 florets. The flowers are cleistogamous, meaning they remain closed and pollinate themselves. This grass also sometimes undergoes apomixis, reproduction without fertilization. This independence of the need for pollination between individuals is one reason why this grass is so widespread and able to tolerate a variety of climates.This is a desirable grass for grazing land because it begins growing earlier in the spring than most other grasses, and it tolerates heavy grazing better than some other grasses because of its basal meristem, that is, new growth occurs low on the grass instead of on the tip where it can be chewed off. This grass is an indicator of ecological climax in many ecosystems."
Danthonia spicata,"Danthonia spicata is a species of grass known by the common name poverty oatgrass, or simply poverty grass. It is native to North America, where it is widespread and common in many areas. The species is distributed across much of Canada and the United States, and its distribution extends into northern Mexico.This perennial bunchgrass is variable in appearance. It has no rhizomes or stolons. It grows anywhere from 7 to 100 cm (2.8 to 39 in) tall. The grass takes the form of a crowded tuft of leaves at ground level. The leaves often become curly and persist as they dry out. Plants in shady and moist areas may not have curly leaves. The inflorescence is a narrow panicle of up to 18 spikelets. The spikelets have twisted, hairy awns. There are also some unopening, cleistogamous florets next to the leaves, and in the panicles. There is a long-lasting soil seed bank, with the seeds persisting for decades before being stimulated to germinate.This grass grows in many types of habitat, and it occurs in a variety of forest and grassland ecosystems. It grows easily on poor, dry, rocky soils, for which it owes its common name. When a habitat is disturbed, after a wildfire, for example, the seeds long-buried in the soil are stimulated and germinate, making the plant a pioneer species that colonizes recently cleared land. It then becomes less common as other plant species begin to move in. It is a common member of the plant community in some ecosystems that are maintained by a regime of frequent fires, such as jack pine (Pinus banksiana) barrens."
Danthonia unispicata,"Danthonia unispicata is a species of grass known by the common name onespike oatgrass, or onespike danthonia.It is sometimes treated as a variety of Danthonia californica, to which it is similar.

Echinochloa crus-galli,"Echinochloa crus-galli is a type of wild grass originating from tropical Asia that was formerly classified as a type of panicum grass. It is commonly known as cockspur (or cockspur grass), barnyard millet, Japanese millet, water grass, common barnyard grass, or simply ""barnyard grass"" (which may refer to any species of Echinochloa or the genus as a whole however). This plant can grow to 60"" (1.5 m) in height and has long, flat leaves which are often purplish at the base. Most stems are upright, but some will spread out over the ground. Stems are flattened at the base. The seed heads are a distinctive feature, often purplish, with large millet-like seeds in crowded spikelets.Considered one of the world's worst weeds, it reduces crop yields and causes forage crops to fail by removing up to 80% of the available soil nitrogen. It acts as a host for several mosaic virus diseases. Heavy infestations can interfere with mechanical harvesting.Individual plants can produce up to 40,000 seeds per year. Water, birds, insects, machinery, and animal feet disperse it, but contaminated seed is probably the most common dispersal method."

It has been observed to increase in abundance after wildfire.This grass makes a good forage for livestock, but it decreases with overgrazing. Some game birds have been noted to eat the seeds."
Eragrostis lehmanniana,"Eragrostis lehmanniana is a species of grass known by the common name Lehmann lovegrass. It is native to southern Africa. It is present elsewhere as an introduced species. It is well known as an invasive weed in some areas, such as Arizona in the United States.This grass produces loose, open clumps of stems up to 61 to 80 centimetres (2.00 to 2.62 ft) long, with some stems growing erect and some lying across the ground and rooting where nodes come in contact with the substrate. The leaves are up to 15 centimetres (5.9 in) long. The inflorescence is a panicle up to 18 centimetres (7.1 in) long by 8 centimetres (3.1 in) wide, with branches appressed to the stems or held out at an angle. The spikelets are up to 1.4 cm (0.55 in) long and contain up to 14 flowers each. The grass may spread via stolons.In its native African range this grass is common in several habitat types such as Acacia woodland and Kalahari grasslands and savanna. It has been introduced to North and South America. In 1930 the grass was introduced to Arizona in the United States to replace the native grasses that had been severely overgrazed by livestock. In the 1940s the grass was spreading and could be found growing in areas where it had not been planted. By 1980 the grass had been sown on over 100,000 acres but it failed to take hold in many regions, such as parts of Texas and New Mexico. In the desert grasslands and shrublands of southeastern Arizona, however, it did well, growing best in areas with sandy soils, rare freezes, and summer rainfall totals of about 15 to 22 cm (5.9 to 8.7 in). Much beyond these parameters it does not spread or fails to survive. In 1988 it was a major species on 347,000 acres of Arizona desert. In parts of the region, the native ecosystem has been replaced by velvet mesquite woodland with an understory dominated by Lehmann lovegrass. This species sometimes hybridizes with Eragrostis curvula (""weeping lovegrass"").The grass produces large monotypic stands that crowd out native grasses and reduce plant and animal diversity. It forms a soil seed bank that can withstand long dry periods, giving it an advantage over some native grasses. It has been shown to have a negative impact on other types of plants, such as Agave palmeri, a key component in the local ecosystem."
Eremochloa ophiuroides,"Eremochloa ophiuroides, or centipedegrass, is a warm season lawn grass. It is a thick sod forming grass that spreads by stolons, and is medium to light green colored.

Festuca campestris,"A fistula (plural: fistulas or fistulae ; from Latin fistula, ""tube, pipe"") in anatomy is an abnormal connection between two hollow spaces (technically, two epithelialized surfaces), such as blood vessels, intestines, or other hollow organs. Types of fistula can be described by their location. Anal fistulas connect between the anal canal and the perianal skin. Anovaginal or rectovaginal fistulas occur when a hole develops between the anus or rectum and the vagina. Colovaginal fistulas occur between the colon and the vagina. Urinary tract fistulas are abnormal openings within the urinary tract or an abnormal connection between the urinary tract and another organ such as between the bladder and the uterus in a vesicouterine fistula, between the bladder and the vagina in a vesicovaginal fistula, and between the urethra and the vagina in urethrovaginal fistula. When occurring between two parts of the intestine, it is known as an enteroenteral fistula, between the small intestine and the skin as an enterocutaneous fistula, and between the colon and the skin as a colocutaneous fistula.Fistulas can result from an infection or inflammation, injury or surgery. Fistulas are sometimes surgically created as part of a treatment, for example arteriovenous fistulas for hemodialysis.Treatment for fistula varies depending on the cause and extent of the fistula, but often involves surgical intervention combined with antibiotic therapy. In some cases the fistula is temporarily covered using a fibrin glue or plug. Catheters may be required to drain a fistula.Globally, every year between 50,000 and 100,000 women are affected by fistula relating to childbirth. In botany, the term is most common in its adjectival forms, where it is used in binomial names to refer to species that are distinguished by hollow or tubular structures. Monarda fistulosa, for example, has tubular flowers. The term was first used in the 14th century."

The plant reproduces by seed and rhizome and it sometimes spreads via stolon."
Festuca thurberi,"Festuca thurberi is a species of grass known by the common name Thurber's fescue. It is native to a section of the western United States encompassing New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming. It probably also occurs in parts of Arizona.This perennial grass forms a large, dense tuft of stout stems which may just exceed one meter in maximum height. It has a fibrous root network and no rhizomes. The roots are generally colonized by various mycorrhizae. The leaves are mostly located at the base of the stems. They feature a ligule which may be nearly one centimeter in length. The inflorescence is a panicle up to 17 centimeters long with spikelets borne on spreading branches a few centimeters long.This grass often occurs at high elevations. It can be found in alpine climates. It grows in several habitat types, usually in cool, dry areas. It is a dominant species in a number of regions throughout its range, growing in forest and woodland understory; it is an indicator species for a number of forest understory types. It occurs at elevations above Arizona fescue but below sheep fescue, with some overlap. It is more often a dominant grass at high elevations than the latter. It is associated with forests of quaking aspen in much of its region. In this habitat it can form a dense, tall, productive understory. In the Rocky Mountains it often begins its growth under the snowpack, producing chlorotic leaves until it encounters sunlight. Some meadows and grasslands are dominated by this species.This grass provides an adequate forage for livestock, more so for cattle than for sheep. Sheep probably find the grass less palatable because of its rough leaves. Cattle grazing in quaking aspen communities consume this grass in large quantities. Many wild animals such as elk utilize the grass as well."

Poa bulbosa,"Poa bulbosa is a species of grass known by the common names bulbous bluegrass or bulbous meadow-grass. It is native to Eurasia and North Africa, but it is present practically worldwide as an introduced species. It is widespread in the United States and southern Canada. It was introduced to the eastern United States around 1906 and the western US in 1915 as a contaminant in shipments of alfalfa seed. It was intentionally planted on both the east and west coasts to control weeds and prevent erosion. Today it is a common grass across the continent and is a noxious weed in some areas. It is a sturdy, hardy, persistent, aggressive grass that easily outcompetes many other plants and becomes the dominant species in disturbed habitat types, such as overgrazed fields.This is an annual or perennial grass forming dense clumps up to about 60 centimeters tall. The stems are smooth and hollow and usually have bulbous sections at their bases about a centimeter in length. The grass is more likely to have bulbous sections if it is growing in a drier area, and study has indicated the bulbous sections are mostly water. If the bulbous bases are detached and replanted they can give rise to new plants. The inflorescence is a wide cluster of branches bearing green leaflike spikelets with darker bases that contain bulbils. Viable seed is rarely produced, and the plant usually reproduces asexually via its basal bulbous sections and via bulbils. Although the plant reproduces vegetatively (asexually) most of the time, it has been shown to possess high genetic variability.Many types of animals, including wild and domesticated ruminants, small mammals, and birds, readily consume this grass, especially the bulbils in the inflorescences, which contain some starches and fats.

Poa cusickii,"Poa cusickii is a species of grass known by the common name Cusick's bluegrass. It is native to western North America from Yukon to Colorado to eastern California, where it grows in many types of habitat, including high mountain meadows and slopes, sagebrush scrub, and forests."
Poa pratensis,"Poa pratensis, commonly known as Kentucky bluegrass (or blue grass), smooth meadow-grass, or common meadow-grass, is a perennial species of grass native to practically all of Europe, North Asia and the mountains of Algeria and Morocco. Although the species is spread over all of the cool, humid parts of the United States, it is not native to North America. The Spanish Empire brought the seeds of Kentucky bluegrass to the New World in mixtures with other grasses. In its native range, Poa pratensis forms a valuable pasture plant, characteristic of well-drained, fertile soil. It is also used for making lawns in parks and gardens and has established itself as a common invasive weed across cool moist climates like the Pacific Northwest, and Northeastern United States. When found on native grasslands in Canada, for example, it is considered an unwelcome exotic plant, and is indicative of a disturbed and degraded landscape."
Poa secunda,"Poa secunda (variously known by the common names of Sandberg bluegrass, alkali bluegrass, big bluegrass, Canby's bluegrass, Nevada bluegrass, one-sided bluegrass, Pacific bluegrass, pine blugrass, slender bluegrass, wild bluegrass, and curly bluegrass) is a widespread species of perennial bunchgrass native to North and South America. It is highly resistant to drought conditions, and provides excellent fodder; and has also been used in controlling soil erosion, and as revegetator, often after forest fires. Cultivars include 'Canbar', 'Service', 'Sherman', and 'Supernova'. Historically,  indigenous Americans, such as the Gosiute of Utah, have used P. secunda for food. It was originally described botanically in 1830 by Jan Svatopluk Presl, from a holotype collected from Chile by Thaddäus Haenke in 1790."
Psathyrostachys juncea,"Psathyrostachys juncea is a species of grass known by the common name Russian wildrye. It was formerly classified as Elymus junceus. It is native to Russia and China, and has been introduced to other parts of the world, such as Canada and the United States. Psathyrostachys juncea is a great source of food for grazing animals, as it has high nutrition value in its dense basal leaves, even in the late summer and autumn seasons. This species can grow and prosper in many harsh environments, making it an ideal candidate for improvement as it can grow in areas were farming is difficult. This species is a drought-resistant forage plant and can survive during the cool seasons. It is also a cross-pollinator and is self-sterile. This means that P. juncea cannot self-fertilize; it must find another plant of the same species with which to exchange gametes. Self-sterilization increases the genetic diversity of a species."
Pseudoroegneria spicata,"Pseudoroegneria spicata is a species of grass known by the common name bluebunch wheatgrass. This native western North American perennial bunchgrass is also known by the scientific synonyms Elymus spicatus and Agropyron spicatum. The grass can be found in the United States, Canada, and Mexico from Alaska and Yukon south as far as Sonora and Nuevo León."
Schedonorus arundinaceus,"Festuca arundinacea (syn., Schedonorus arundinaceus and Lolium arundinaceum) is a species of grass commonly known as tall fescue. It is a cool-season perennial C3 species of bunchgrass native to Europe.  It is an important forage grass throughout Europe, and many cultivars have been used in agriculture. It is also an ornamental grass in gardens, and a phytoremediation plant.The predominant cultivar found in British pastures is S170, an endophyte-free variety. In its native European environment, tall fescue is found in damp grasslands, river banks, and in coastal seashore locations.  Its distribution is a factor of climatic, edaphic, or other environmental attributes. In New Zealand, where it is introduced, the species is particularly prolific in salt marshes, where it is often a major part of the plant biota."
Schedonorus pratensis,"Festuca pratensis, the meadow fescue, is a perennial species of grass, which is often used as an ornamental grass in gardens, and is also an important forage crop.It grows in meadows, roadsides, old pastures, and riversides on moist, rich soils, especially on loamy and heavy soils.It is a tall, tufted grass similar to the tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea.  Tall fescue differs by having minute hairs on the auricles.  It can hybridise with Lolium perenne and Lolium multiflorum."
Schizachyrium scoparium,"Schizachyrium scoparium, commonly known as little bluestem or beard grass, is a species of North American prairie grass native to most of the contiguous United States (except California, Nevada, and Oregon) as well as a small area north of the Canada–US border and northern Mexico. It is most common in the Midwestern prairies.Little bluestem is a perennial bunchgrass and is prominent in tallgrass prairie, along with big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). It is a warm-season species, meaning it employs the C4 photosynthetic pathway."
Schizachyrium tenerum,"Schizachyrium tenerum is a species of grass known by the common name slender little bluestem, or slender bluestem. It is native to the Americas, where it occurs in North, Central, and South America. In North America it can be found in the southeastern United States and much of Mexico.This plant produces bunches of erect or leaning stems up to a meter long. The wiry leaves are up to 15 or 20 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a raceme of paired spikelets. The fertile spikelet has an awn up to a centimeter long; the sterile spikelet lacks an awn.In the United States this grass grows in pine forests and on the coastal plain. It and the pinehill bluestem (S. scoparium var. divergens) may codominate habitat in the understory of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris). It grows in pine savanna, seeps, pitcher plant bogs, dry prairies, sandhills, and floodplains."
Schoenoplectus acutus,"Schoenoplectus acutus (syn. Scirpus acutus, Schoenoplectus lacustris, Scirpus lacustris  subsp. acutus),  called tule , common tule, hardstem tule, tule rush, hardstem bulrush, or viscid bulrush, is a giant species of sedge in the plant family Cyperaceae, native to freshwater marshes all over North America. The common name derives from the Nāhuatl word tōllin [ˈtoːlːin], and was first applied by the early settlers from New Spain who recognized the marsh plants in the Central Valley of California as similar to those in the marshes around Mexico City.Tules once lined the shores of Tulare Lake, California, formerly the largest freshwater lake in the western United States. It was drained by land speculators in the 20th century. The expression ""out in the tules"" is still common, deriving from the dialect of old Californian families and meaning ""where no one would want to live"", with a touch of irony. The phrase is comparable to ""out in the boondocks"".Schoenoplectus acutus has a thick, rounded green stem growing to 1 to 3 m (3 to 10 ft) tall, with long, grasslike leaves, and radially symmetrical, clustered, pale brownish flowers. Tules at shorelines play an important ecological role, helping to buffer against wind and water forces, thereby allowing the establishment of other types of plants and reducing erosion. Tules are sometimes cleared from waterways using herbicides. When erosion occurs, tule rhizomes are replanted in strategic areas.The two varieties are:Schoenoplectus acutus var. acutus – northern and eastern North AmericaSchoenoplectus acutus var. occidentalis – southwestern North America"
Schoenoplectus americanus,"Schoenoplectus americanus (syn. Scirpus americanus) is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family known by the common names chairmaker's bulrush and Olney's three-square bulrush. It is native to the Americas, where it is known from Alaska to Nova Scotia and all the way into southern South America; it is most common along the East and Gulf Coasts of the United States and in parts of the western states. It grows in many types of coastal and inland wetland habitat, as well as sagebrush, desert scrub, chaparral, and plains. This rhizomatous perennial herb easily exceeds two meters in height. The stiff stems are sharply three-angled and usually very concave between the edges. Each plant has three or fewer leaves which are short and narrow. The inflorescence is a small head of several spikelets which may be brown to bright orange, red, purplish, or pale and translucent. They have hairy edges. The fruit is a brown achene. The plant reproduces sexually by seed and colonies spread via vegetative reproduction, sprouting from the rhizomes.This plant, particularly the rhizomes, are a food source of muskrat, nutria, and other animals; it is strongly favored by the snow goose in its wintering grounds.Native American groups used this plant for many purposes, including food, basketry, and hatmaking. It is used for revegetation projects in salt marsh habitat in its native range. It is a model organism in the study of salt marsh ecology and its response to climate change (currently global warming)."
Schoenoplectus subterminalis,"Schoenoplectus subterminalis  is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family known by the common names water bulrush, water club-rush, and swaying bulrush. It is native to North America, where it is known from many parts of the Canada and the United States. It has been common in the northeastern US and eastern Canada as well as the Great Lakes region, as well as many locations in the mountains of the West, though apparently absent from the Southwest and from most of the Great Plains.Schoenoplectus subterminalis grows in moist and wet habitat, and often grows in shallow water, sometimes entirely submerged. It is a perennial herb forming mats or tufts of very narrow cylindrical stems easily exceeding one meter long. There is a rhizome and sometimes tubers grow on it. When the plant grows in water only the inflorescences and the tips of the leaf blades break the surface. The inflorescence is generally a single cone-shaped spikelet at the end of the stem accompanied by a stiff, stemlike bract."
Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani,"Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani (syn. Scirpus validus) is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family known by the common names softstem bulrush, grey club-rush, and great bulrush. It can be found throughout much of the world; it has been reported from every state in the United States (including Hawaii), and from every province and territory in Canada except Nunavut. It grows in moist and wet habitat, and sometimes in shallow water.Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani is quite variable in appearance, thus explaining the long list of synonyms that have been created over the years. It is a perennial herb producing dense stands of many narrow erect stems reaching 1–3 m (33–100 inches) in height. It grows from a long rhizome system. The leaves are mostly basal and have wide sheaths around the stems. The inflorescence is generally a panicle of spikelets on long, thin branches which spread, arch, or droop. The spikelets vary in color. There is usually a long, stiff bract alongside each spikelet or cluster of spikelets.A cultivar of this species with bright horizontal white or yellowish stripes, S. tabernaemontani 'Zebrinus', is sold as an ornamental plant for water gardens and landscaping. Solid white and yellow cultivars are also available.The new shoots and young roots may be eaten raw or cooked. The older roots can be made into flour."
Scolochloa festucacea,"Scolochloa is a genus of grasses in the family Poaceae / Gramineae, now containing a single species, Scolochloa festucacea. Common rivergrass is a common name for the species. Scolochloa festucacea grows in Europe, temperate Asia, and North America. Its culms are erect and 100–150 centimetres (39–59 in) in height; its leaf blades are 15–30 cm (5.9–11.8 in) long and 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) wide.The genus formerly included a second species, Scolochloa arundinacea, which is now placed in the genus Arundo as Arundo donax."
Sorghum halepense,"Johnson grass or Johnsongrass, Sorghum halepense,  is a plant in the grass family, Poaceae, native to Asia and northern Africa. The plant has been introduced to all continents except Antarctica, and most larger islands and archipelagos. It reproduces by rhizomes and seeds.Johnson grass has been used for forage and to stop erosion, but it is often considered a weed because:Foliage that becomes wilted from frost or hot, dry weather can contain sufficient amounts of hydrogen cyanide to kill cattle and horses if it is eaten in quantity.The foliage can cause 'bloat' in such herbivores from the accumulation of excessive nitrates; otherwise, it is edible.It grows and spreads rapidly, it can 'choke out' other cash crops planted by farmers.This species occurs in crop fields, pastures, abandoned fields, rights-of-way, forest edges, and along streambanks. It thrives in open, disturbed, rich, bottom ground, particularly in cultivated fields.Johnson grass that is resistant to the common herbicide glyphosate has been found in Argentina and the United States. It is considered to be one of the ten worst weeds in the world.  In the United States, Johnson grass is listed as either a noxious or quarantined weed in 19 states. With Sorghum bicolor it is a parent of Sorghum × almum, a forage crop also considered a weed in places.It is named after an Alabama plantation owner, Colonel William Johnson, who sowed its seeds on river-bottom farm land circa 1840. The plant was already established in several US states a decade earlier, having been introduced as a prospective forage or accidentally as a seedlot contaminant.In early 20th century Talladega County, there were mixed feelings about Johnson grass. It was considered a nutritious, palatable and productive forage, but many farmers still found it undesirable. Fields of this grass fell into a ""sod bound"" state of insufficient new growth unless they were plowed every two or three seasons.A genetic study employing microsatellite markers has investigated Johnsongrass populations across 12 states and confirmed that the weed was introduced to US from Alabama and North Carolina. Moreover, the study also detected an unreported independent introduction from Arizona. After trans-continental railroad building the two founding populations began to intermix at around Texas shifting diversity from centers of introduction.The 1889 book The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that Sorghum halepense is a ""strong, erect-growing species, varying from two to ten feet high, succulent when young, a splendid grass for a cattle run, though not much sought after by sheep. It is a free seeder. The settlers on the banks of the Hawkesbury (New South Wales) look upon it as a recent importation, and seed of it has been distributed under the name of Panicum speciabile. (WooUs) Coast of Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia."""
Sorghastrum nutans,"Sorghastrum nutans, commonly known as either Indiangrass or yellow Indiangrass, is a North American prairie grass found in the central and eastern United States and Canada, especially in the Great Plains and tallgrass prairies."
Spartina alterniflora,None
Spartina patens,"Spartina patens, the saltmeadow cordgrass, also known as salt hay, is a species of cordgrass native to the Atlantic coast of the Americas, from Newfoundland south along the eastern United States to the Caribbean and northeast Mexico. It has been reclassified as Sporobolus pumilus after a taxonomic revision in 2014, but Spartina patens is still in common usage. It can be found in marshlands in other areas of the world as an introduced species and often a harmful noxious weed or invasive species.It is a hay-like grass found in the upper areas of brackish coastal salt marshes. It is a slender and wiry plant that grows in thick mats 30–60 cm high, green in spring and summer, and turns light brown in late fall and winter. The stems are wispy and hollow, and the leaves roll inward and appear round. Because its stems are weak, the wind and water action can bend the grass, creating the appearance of a field of tufts and cowlicks. Like its relative smooth cordgrass S. alterniflora, saltmeadow cordgrass produces flowers and seeds on only one side of the stalk. Flowers are a deep purple from June to October and turn brown in the winter months.Saltmeadow cordgrass is found in high marsh zones where it is covered at times by high tides. Specialized cells are able to exclude salt from entering the roots, preventing the loss of fresh water. This grass is, however, less tolerant of saltwater than some other marsh grasses. It can also grow on beaches and can quickly recolonize an overwash zoneA healthy salt marsh depends on the presence of plants such as salt hay grass and smooth cordgrass. These grasses provide rich habitat for crustaceans, mollusks, and birds, and serve as a major source of organic nutrients for the entire estuary. Mats of salt hay grass are inhabited by many small animals and are an important food source for ducks and seaside sparrows.Saltmeadow cordgrass marshes serve as pollution filters and as buffers against flooding and shoreline erosion. During the colonial era, towns scattered from Narragansett Bay to the Gulf of Maine were often settled based on their proximity to salt marshes due to the importance of saltmeadow cordgrass for fodder. It was harvested for bedding and fodder for farm animals and for garden mulch. Before hay was baled and stored under cover, it was used to top the hay stacks in the fields.Many of the salt marshes in Rhode Island have been severely affected by filling, development, and road construction. These alterations restrict tidal flow, often having a severe ecological impact on the marsh. Because saltmeadow cordgrass requires a salty, wet habitat, restricted tidal flow often dries out the marsh and encourages the growth of invasive freshwater plants. Saltmeadow and smooth cordgrasses are often out-competed for space by common reed in areas where human activity has disturbed or altered the marsh. Common reed is not as productive or beneficial to a salt marsh as cordgrass.While this Spartina is a key member of the salt marsh flora in its native habitat, it is known as a harmful invasive species in other parts of the world. It is a notorious pest in the San Francisco Bay Area, where it out-competes native plants such as the soft salty bird's beak Chloropyron molle ssp. molle (synonym, Cordylanthus mollis ssp. mollis) and alters the habitat of rare animals such as the Ridgway's rail (Rallus obsoletus obsoletus). This cordgrass was introduced to the estuaries of Oregon with shipments of oysters and has been seen dominating and crowding out native vegetation there. It has appeared in marshes on the Iberian Peninsula, where it threatens native plant biodiversity."
Spartina pectinata,"Spartina pectinata is a species of cordgrass known as prairie cordgrass, freshwater cordgrass, tall marshgrass, and sloughgrass. It is native to much of North America, including central and eastern Canada and most of the contiguous United States except for the southwestern and southeastern regions. Its distribution extends into Mexico. It is also present on other continents as an introduced species."
Sporobolus airoides,"Sporobolus airoides is a species of grass known by the common name alkali sacaton. It is native to western North America, including the Western United States west of the Mississippi River, British Columbia and Alberta in Canada, and northern and central Mexico.

Sporobolus cryptandrus,"Sporobolus cryptandrus is a species of grass known as sand dropseed. It is native to North America, where it is widespread in southern Canada, most of the United States, and northern Mexico."
Sporobolus flexuous,"Since the first printing of Carl Linnaeus's Species Plantarum in 1753, plants have been assigned one epithet or name for their species and one name for their genus, a grouping of related species. These scientific names have been catalogued in a variety of works, including Stearn's Dictionary of Plant Names for Gardeners. William Stearn (1911–2001) was one of the pre-eminent British botanists of the 20th century: a Librarian of the Royal Horticultural Society, a president of the Linnean Society and the original drafter of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants.The first column below lists seed-bearing species epithets from Stearn's Dictionary, Latin for Gardeners by Lorraine Harrison, The A to Z of Plant Names by Allen Coombes, The Gardener's Botanical by Ross Bayton, and the glossary of Stearn's Botanical Latin. Epithets from proper nouns, proper adjectives, and two or more nouns are excluded, along with epithets used only in species names that are no longer widely accepted. Classical and modern meanings are provided in the third column, along with citations to Charlton T. Lewis's An Elementary Latin Dictionary."
Sporobolus heterolepis,"Sporobolus heterolepis, commonly known as prairie dropseed, is a species of prairie grass native to the tallgrass and mixed grass prairies of central North America from Texas to southern Canada. It is also found further east,  to the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada, but is much less common beyond the Great Plains and is restricted to specialized habitats. It is found in 27 states and four Canadian provinces."
Sporobolus wrightii,Sporobolus wrightii is a species of grass known by the common names big sacaton and giant sacaton. It is native to the western United States and northern and central Mexico.
Taeniatherum caput-medusae,"Taeniatherum is a genus of Eurasian and North African plants in the grass family known by the common name medusahead.The only recognized species is Taeniatherum caput-medusae and is native to southern and central Europe (from Portugal to European Russia), North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia), and Asia (from Turkey + Saudi Arabia to Pakistan + Kazakhstan). It is also naturalized in south Australia, Chile, and parts of North America.This aggressive winter annual grass is changing the ecology of western rangelands in North America. It was first observed in the United States in Oregon in 1903 by Thomas Howell. Forty-eight percent of the total land area of the United States is rangeland, pastureland, national parks, nature preserves, and other wildlands.  These lands are essential for agriculture and for protecting the integrity of ecological systems. Natural areas contain many nonnative plant species that occur as self-sustaining populations in the lower 48 of the United States, including medusahead. As of 2005, medusahead infested approximately 972,700 acres (3,936 km2) in the 17 western states (from North Dakota south to Texas and west to the Pacific coast), and spreads at an average rate of 12% per year. As medusahead spreads, it can outcompete native vegetation in overgrazed rangelands, reduces land value, and creates a wildfire hazard."
Trichophorum alpinum,"Alpine bulrush or cotton deergrass (Trichophorum alpinum) is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family. It has a circumboreal distribution, occurring throughout the northern latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. It is present in Europe, Asia, and northern North America.This sedge produces stems up to 40 centimeters (16 in) tall from a short rhizome. The leaves are no more than a centimeter long. The flowers have cottony white bristles that may extend 2 centimeters (0.79 in) past the spikelet.This plant grows in bogs and calcareous mountain meadows."

Urochloa mutica,"Brachiaria mutica is a species of grass known by the common names para grass, buffalo grass, Mauritius signal grass, pasto pare, malojilla, gramalote, parana, Carib grass, and Scotch grass. Despite its common name California grass, it does not occur in California; it is native to northern and central Africa and parts of the Middle East, where it is cultivated for fodder. It was introduced elsewhere and it is now cultivated throughout tropical regions of the world for this purpose."
Vulpia microstachys,"Vulpia microstachys is a species of grass known by the common names small fescue and small sixweeks grass. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to Colorado and New Mexico to Baja California, where it grows in many types of open habitat, including grasslands. It is dominant on some grasslands of California, and it was probably an abundant native grass before the habitat was altered by invasive non-native grasses. It occurs on serpentine soils with associates such as serpentine reedgrass (Calamagrostis ophitidis). It is also known from parts of South America. It is an annual grass producing one stem or a clump of several stems growing up to 75 centimeters tall. The inflorescence has several open branches bearing clusters of purple-tinged spikelets. The spikelet has one to six flowers. The grass is usually cleistogamous, its flowers fertilizing themselves.There are four varieties which are sometimes difficult to tell apart; they are separated on the basis of the arrangement and amount of hairs on the spikelets.V. m. var. ciliata - Eastwood fescueV. m. var. confusa - confusing fescueV. m. var. microstachys - desert fescueV. m. var. pauciflora - Pacific fescue"
Vulpia myuros,"Vulpia myuros, the annual fescue, or rat's-tail fescue, is an annual grass species of the genus Vulpia. It was probably originally native to Eurasia, but it can now be found nearly worldwide as a naturalized species.In the United Kingdom it forms dense, even swards of fine, hair-like stems in recently disturbed habitats. It is often eventually displaced by perennial grasses."
Vulpia octoflora,"Festuca octoflora, also known as Vulpia octoflora,  is an annual plant in the grass family (Poaceae). The common name six week fescue is because it supplies about 6 weeks of cattle forage after a rain.  Other common names include sixweeks fescue, six-weeks fescue, pullout grass, eight-flower sixweeks grass, or eight-flowered fescue."
