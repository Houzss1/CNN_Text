Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2,"Naruto: Clash of Ninja, released in Japan as Naruto: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! (NARUTO (ナルト) 激闘忍者大戦!), is a series of 3D cel-shaded fighting games based on the manga and anime series Naruto by Masashi Kishimoto. They are developed by Eighting and published by D3 Publisher and Tomy.  The series began with four GameCube games, with the first two available internationally and the last two released exclusively in Japan, before splitting into two parallel Wii-exclusive follow-up series: the Gekitō Ninja Taisen EX tetralogy released exclusively in Japan and its international counterpart, the Clash of Ninja: Revolution trilogy.  The two Wii series share the same gameplay mechanics, but differ with respect to content and characters, with the international Revolution series being based on a localized version of the Naruto anime series.  The first half of the original series and the entire Revolution trilogy are available in North America and Europe, (although the first Clash of Ninja wasn't released in the latter) the first two Revolution games are available in Australasia and all games in the series except the Revolution trilogy are available in Japan.Each installment of the series has had numerous methods of play with varying types of modes. New games have introduced additional modes that appear in subsequent games. The player directly controls a character taken from the Naruto series, and uses their unique abilities to battle and defeat an opponent. New games in the series include more of the Naruto plotline in a story mode, and it tends to stay true to the source material. As a result, the character selection generally increases with each installment due to the inclusion of more of the Naruto plotline, with some exceptions. With the final Revolution game and the entire EX series incorporating Naruto: Shippūden, the second part of the Naruto series, many of the characters have been substantially redesigned, and the selection correspondingly limited. Reactions to early installments were mixed, while later titles have been received more positively, with many praising the simple and easy-to-learn fighting system while others lambasting the fighting system, and the lack of significant unlockable content."
