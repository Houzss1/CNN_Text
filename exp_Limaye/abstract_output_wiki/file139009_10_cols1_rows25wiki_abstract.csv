 Sideshow Bob Roberts  Bill Oakley &amp; Josh Weinstein  ,"Media is a recurring theme of satire on The Simpsons. The show is known for its satire of American popular culture and especially television culture, but has since its inception covered all types of media such as animation, journalism, commercials, comic books, movies, internet, and music. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town but the town of Springfield acts as a complete universe. The town features a vast array of media channelsâ€”from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.Most of The Simpsons media satire focuses on television. This is mainly done through three characters: Krusty the Clown, Sideshow Bob, and until 1998 Troy McClure. The Itchy & Scratchy Show is a show within a show,  used as a satire of animation and in some cases The Simpsons itself. Topics include censorship, plagiarism, unoriginal writing, live-action clip shows and documentaries.  Kent Brockman, Springfield's principal news presenter illustrates the glibness, amplification, and sensationalism of broadcast journalism.  His tabloidization methods include making people look guilty without trial, and invasion of privacy by setting up camp outside people's homes."

When he was unsuccessful in getting the program pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing Brooks.The episode was directed by Susie Dietter and was the first episode to be written by Ken Keeler.
