 Cape Feare ( Sideshow Bob Returns ) Rich Moore   ,"Dr. Robert Underdunk ""Bob"" Terwilliger Jr., PhD, better known as Sideshow Bob, is a guest character  in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Kelsey Grammer and first appeared in the episode ""The Telltale Head"". Bob is a self-proclaimed genius who is a graduate of Yale University, a member of the Republican Party, and a champion of high culture. He began his career as a sidekick on Krusty the Clown's television show, but after enduring constant abuse, Bob framed his employer for armed robbery in ""Krusty Gets Busted"", but was foiled by Bart Simpson, and Bob was sent to prison. Bob started seeking revenge against Bart while in prison, and the two became feuding arch-enemies.Bob made his second major appearance in season three's ""Black Widower""; the writers echoed the premise of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life, threatening to disrupt and end it through murder. Starting with that appearance and thereafter, Bob has assumed the role on The Simpsons of an evil genius. Episodes in which he is a central character typically involve Sideshow Bob being released from prison and executing an elaborate revenge plan, usually foiled by Bart and Lisa. His plans often involve death and destruction, usually targeted at Bart or, less often, Krusty, though he starts targeting the entire Simpson family in season 17. In season 27, however, during the ""Treehouse of Horror"" segment, ""Wanted: Dead, Then Alive"", Bob finally gets his wish of killing Bart, commenting that he spent 24 years trying to kill a ten-year-old child; however, he becomes bored with Bart dead, so he brings him back to life so that he can repeatedly kill Bart over and over again.Despite his villainous deeds, Sideshow Bob shares some personality traits of Grammer's character Dr. Frasier Crane from the sitcoms Cheers and Frasier, and has been described as ""Frasier pickled in arsenic"". Several parallels have been explicitly drawn in The Simpsons between Bob and Frasier Craneâ€”Bob's brother Cecil and his father were played by David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney, respectively, echoing the roles they played in Frasier. Grammer, who based Bob's voice on that of actor Ellis Rabb, has been praised for his portrayals of the character. In 2006, he won an Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his work in the episode ""The Italian Bob"".As of December 15, 2019, Bob has appeared in more than 40 episodes, had speaking appearances in 23 of these, and been featured as the main character in 14; the most recent of the latter, ""Bobby, It's Cold Outside"", aired on said date during the 31st season. In addition to his recurring role in the series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other Simpsons media and is mentioned in several more episodes. He appears in the Simpsons Comics, cameos in the 2007 video game The Simpsons Game, and stars as the main antagonist in The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios' theme parks. A lover of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, Sideshow Bob is also known for his singing voice; several of Grammer's performances have been included in The Simpsons musical compilations."
