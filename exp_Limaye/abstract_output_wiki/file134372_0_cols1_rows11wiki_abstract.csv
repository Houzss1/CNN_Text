Alexander Mackenzie   ,"Sir Alexander Mackenzie (or MacKenzie, Scottish Gaelic: Alasdair MacCoinnich; c. 1764 – 12 March 1820) was a Scottish  explorer known for accomplishing the first east to west crossing of America north of Mexico in 1793, which preceded the more famous Lewis and Clark Expedition by 12 years. The Mackenzie River is named after him."

Wilfrid Laurier   ,"Sir Henri Charles Wilfrid Laurier,  ( LORR-ee-ay; French: [wilfʁid loʁje]; 20 November 1841 – 17 February 1919) was a Canadian politician and statesman who served as the seventh prime minister of Canada, in office from 11 July 1896 to 6 October 1911.Laurier is often considered one of the country's greatest statesmen. He is well-known for his policies of conciliation, expanding Confederation, and compromise between French and English Canada. His vision for Canada was a land of individual liberty and decentralized federalism.  He also argued for an English–French partnership in Canada. ""I have had before me as a pillar of fire,"" he said, ""a policy of true Canadianism, of moderation, of reconciliation."" He passionately defended individual liberty, ""Canada is free and freedom is its nationality,"" and ""Nothing will prevent me from continuing my task of preserving at all cost our civil liberty."" Laurier was also well-regarded for his efforts to establish Canada as an autonomous country within the British Empire, and he supported the continuation of the Empire if it was based on ""absolute liberty political and commercial"". Laurier oversaw the creation of the Royal Canadian Navy and sent a volunteer force to fight in the Second Boer War. In addition, he was a strict nationalist, argued for a more competitive Canada through limited government, and was an adherent of fiscal discipline.A 2011 Maclean's historical ranking of the Prime Ministers placed Laurier first. Canada's first francophone prime minister, Laurier holds a number of records. He is tied with John A. Macdonald for the most consecutive federal elections won (four), and his 15-year tenure remains the longest unbroken term of office among prime ministers. In addition, his nearly 45 years (1874–1919) of service in the House of Commons is a record for that house. At 31 years, 8 months, Laurier was the longest-serving leader of a major Canadian political party, surpassing William Lyon Mackenzie King by over two years. Along with King, he also holds the distinction of serving as Prime Minister during the reigns of three Canadian Monarchs. He is the fourth-longest serving Prime Minister of Canada, behind King, Macdonald, and Pierre Trudeau."

William Lyon Mackenzie King   ,"William Lyon Mackenzie King  (December 17, 1874 – July 22, 1950) was a Canadian statesman and politician who served as the 10th prime minister of Canada for three non-consecutive terms from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930 and 1935 to 1948. A Liberal, he was the dominant politician in Canada during both the interwar period and World War II, from the 1920s through the 1940s. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (1939–1945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining morale on the home front. With a total of 21 years and 154 days in office, he remains the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was ""Help those that cannot help themselves""), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state.Born in Kitchener, Ontario, King entered the House of Commons in 1908 before acceding to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1919, following the death of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Taking the helm of a party bitterly torn apart during the First World War due to the Conscription Crisis of 1917, he unified factions of the Liberal Party, leading it to victory in the 1921 election. The party was out of office during the harshest days of the Great Depression in Canada, 1930–35; King returned when the economy was on an upswing. He personally handled complex relations with the Prairie provinces, while his top aides Ernest Lapointe and Louis St. Laurent skillfully met the demands of French Canadians. During the Second World War, he carefully avoided the battles over conscription, patriotism and ethnicity that had divided Canada so deeply in the First World War. Though few major policy innovations took place during his premiership, he was able to synthesize and pass a number of measures that had reached a level of broad national support. Scholars attribute King's long tenure as party leader to his wide range of skills that were appropriate to Canada's needs. He understood the workings of capital and labour. Keenly sensitive to the nuances of public policy, he was a workaholic with a shrewd and penetrating intelligence and a profound understanding of the complexities of Canadian society. A modernizing technocrat who regarded managerial mediation as essential to an industrial society, he wanted his Liberal Party to represent liberal corporatism to create social harmony. King worked to bring compromise and harmony to many competing and feuding elements, using politics and government action as his instrument. He led his party for 29 years, led the country for just over 21 years, and established Canada's international reputation as a middle power fully committed to world order.King's biographers agree on the personal characteristics that made him distinctive. He lacked the charisma of such contemporaries as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, or Charles de Gaulle. He lacked a commanding presence or oratorical skill; his best writing was academic, and did not resonate with the electorate. Cold and tactless in human relations, he had many political allies but very few close personal friends. He never married and lacked a hostess whose charm could substitute for his chill. He kept secret his beliefs in spiritualism and use of mediums to stay in contact with departed associates and particularly with his mother, and allowed his intense spirituality to distort his understanding of Adolf Hitler throughout the late 1930s. A survey of scholars in 1997 by Maclean's magazine ranked King first among all Canada's prime ministers, ahead of John A. Macdonald and Wilfrid Laurier. As historian Jack Granatstein notes, ""the scholars expressed little admiration for King the man but offered unbounded admiration for his political skills and attention to Canadian unity."""
Louis St . Laurent   ,"Louis Stephen St. Laurent  (Saint-Laurent or St-Laurent in French, baptized Louis-Étienne St-Laurent; 1 February 1882 – 25 July 1973) was a Canadian politician and lawyer who served as the 12th prime minister of Canada, from 15 November 1948 to 21 June 1957. Born and raised in southeastern Quebec, St. Laurent was a leading lawyer and a supporter of the Liberal Party of Canada. He was notable for having strong support within the Catholic francophone community. In February 1942, St. Laurent entered politics as he won a by-election in the riding of Quebec East and immediately became Minister of Justice under prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. In September 1946, St. Laurent became Secretary of State for External Affairs and served in that post until two years later, where he became leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister, succeeding King who retired. St. Laurent carried the party to back-to-back majority governments in the federal elections of 1949 and 1953.The second French Canadian to hold the office, St. Laurent strongly advocated against communism, and was an enthusiastic proponent of Canada joining NATO in 1949 to fight the spread of the ideology, overcoming opposition from some intellectuals, the Labor-Progressive Party, and many French Canadians. St. Laurent was a leading figure in the establishment of a UN military force in 1956 and at home oversaw the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway, the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Trans-Canada Pipeline. After eight and a half years in power, St. Laurent and the Liberals were unexpectedly and narrowly defeated by John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservatives in the 1957 federal election. According to historian Donald Creighton, he was neither an idealist nor a bookish intellectual, but an ""eminently moderate, cautious...man...and a strong Canadian nationalist."""
Lester B . Pearson   ,"Lester Bowles Pearson  (23 April 1897 – 27 December 1972) was a Canadian scholar, statesman, soldier, and diplomat who served as the 14th prime minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968, as the head of two back-to-back Liberal minority governments won in the elections of 1963 and 1965.Born in Toronto, Pearson pursued a career in the Department of External Affairs. From 1948 to 1957, he served as Secretary of State for External Affairs under Prime Ministers William Lyon Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent. He narrowly lost the bid to become Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1953. However, he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for organizing the United Nations Emergency Force to resolve the Suez Canal Crisis, which earned him praise and attention worldwide. After the Liberals' sudden defeat in the 1957 federal election, Pearson easily won the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1958. Pearson suffered two consecutive defeats by incumbent Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in 1958 and 1962, only to successfully challenge him for a third time in the 1963 federal election.During Pearson's tenure as prime minister, his government launched progressive policies such as universal health care, the Canada Student Loan Program, and the Canada Pension Plan. He also introduced the Order of Canada, and the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. Pearson oversaw the creation of the Maple Leaf flag that was implemented in 1965. His government unified Canada's armed forces and kept Canada out of the Vietnam War. In 1967, Canada became the first country in the world to implement a points-based immigration system. After nearly half a decade in power, Pearson resigned as Prime Minister and retired from politics.With his government programs and policies, together with his groundbreaking work at the United Nations and in international diplomacy, which included his role in ending the Suez Crisis, Pearson is generally considered among the most influential Canadians of the 20th century and is ranked among the greatest Canadian prime ministers."
Pierre Trudeau   ,"Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau  ( TROO-doh, troo-DOH, French: [pjɛʁ tʁydo]; October 18, 1919 – September 28, 2000), also referred to by the initials PET, was a Canadian politician who served as the 15th prime minister of Canada (1968–1979, 1980–1984) and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada from 1968 to 1984, with a brief period instead as Leader of the Opposition in 1979 and 1980. Trudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer, intellectual, and activist in Quebec politics. Although he aligned himself with the social democratic New Democratic Party, Trudeau felt that they could not achieve power and instead joined the Liberal Party. He was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1965, quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson's Parliamentary Secretary. In 1967, he was appointed Minister of Justice and Attorney General. Trudeau's outgoing personality and charismatic nature caused a media sensation, inspiring ""Trudeaumania"", and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968, when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada. From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, Trudeau's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life. After his appointment as Prime Minister, he won the 1968, 1972 and 1974 elections, before narrowly losing in 1979. He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards, in 1980, and eventually retired from politics shortly before the 1984 election. Trudeau won three majority governments and one minority government during his tenure, and he is the last Prime Minister of Canada to win more than three terms. His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada's third longest-serving Prime Minister, behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald.Despite his personal motto, ""Reason before passion"", his personality and policy decisions aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office. While critics accused him of arrogance, of economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Quebec and the economy of the Prairies, admirers praised what they considered to be the force of Trudeau's intellect and his political acumen that maintained national unity over the Quebec sovereignty movement and the 1980 Quebec referendum. Trudeau suppressed the 1970 Quebec terrorist crisis by controversially invoking the War Measures Act, the third and last time in Canadian history that the act was brought into force. In a bid to move the Liberal Party towards economic nationalism, Trudeau's government oversaw the creation of Petro-Canada and launched the National Energy Program, a policy that was extremely unpopular in Western Canada and particularly in the oil-rich province of Alberta, leading to what many coined ""Western alienation"". In other domestic policy, Trudeau pioneered official bilingualism and multiculturalism, fostering a pan-Canadian identity. Trudeau's foreign policy included making Canada less dependent on the United States and the United Kingdom. He patriated the Constitution and established the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, actions that granted full Canadian sovereignty. He formed close ties with the Soviet Union, China, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro, putting him at odds with other capitalist Western nations. Trudeau is ranked highly among contemporary scholars in retrospective rankings of Canadian prime ministers. His eldest son, Justin Trudeau, became the 23rd and current Prime Minister, following the 2015, 2019, and 2021 federal elections, and is the first prime minister of Canada to be the child or other descendant of a former prime minister."
John Turner   ,"John Napier Wyndham Turner  (June 7, 1929 – September 19, 2020) was a Canadian politician and lawyer who served as the 17th prime minister of Canada from June 30 to September 17, 1984.Turner served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau as Minister of Justice from 1968 to 1972, and Minister of Finance from 1972 to 1975. Amid a global recession and the prospect of having to implement unpopular wage and price controls, Turner resigned from his position in 1975.After a hiatus from politics from 1975 to 1984, Turner returned and successfully contested the 1984 Liberal leadership. Turner held the office of Prime Minister for 79 days, the second-shortest tenure in Canadian history after Sir Charles Tupper, as he advised the Governor General to dissolve Parliament immediately after being sworn in and went on to lose the 1984 election in a landslide to Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives. Turner stayed on as Liberal leader and led the Opposition for the next six years, leading his party to a modest recovery in the 1988 election. He resigned as Liberal leader in 1990 and did not seek re-election in 1993.Turner was Canada's first Prime Minister born in the United Kingdom since Mackenzie Bowell in 1896. He was the fourth longest-lived Prime Minister, living to the age of 91."

Paul Martin   ,"Paul Edgar Philippe Martin  (born August 28, 1938), also known as Paul Martin Jr., is a Canadian lawyer, politician, and author who served as the 21st prime minister of Canada and the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada from 2003 to 2006.Martin served as the Member of Parliament for the riding of LaSalle—Émard in Montreal from his election in 1988 to his retirement in 2008. He unsuccessfully ran for leader of the Liberal Party in 1990, losing to Jean Chrétien, whom Martin would form a long-time rivalry against. When the Liberals under Chrétien won a landslide majority government in the 1993 federal election, Martin was appointed his minister of Finance and held that position until 2002. He oversaw many changes in the financial structure of the Canadian government, and his policies had a direct effect on eliminating the country's chronic fiscal deficit by reforming various programs including social services.On November 14, 2003, Martin succeeded Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party and became prime minister on December 12, 2003. After the 2004 election, his Liberal Party retained power, although only as a minority government. During his tenure, Martin's government signed the Kelowna Accord and legalized same-sex marriage. In 2005, a motion of no confidence was passed, and an election was triggered. As a result of the emerging details surrounding his predecessor's sponsorship scandal, as well as a unified Conservative Party, Martin was defeated by Stephen Harper's Tories, ending over 12 years of Liberal rule. Martin stepped down as leader of the Liberals on March 18, handing the reins to Bill Graham who was later permanently succeeded by Stéphane Dion. Now seen as a global diplomat, Martin continues to contribute on the international arena through a variety of initiatives such as Incentives for Global Health, the not-for-profit behind the Health Impact Fund, where he serves as a member of the Advisory Board. He also sits as an advisor to Canada's Ecofiscal Commission."
