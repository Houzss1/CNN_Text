Red Deer College   ,"Red Deer College (RDC) was a public comprehensive community college of approximately 7,000 students in credit programs and 10,000 in non-credit programming located in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. Established in 1964, RDC was built for a smaller semi-rural community but, in the four and a half decades since its founding, the city has grown into the third (now fourth) largest in the province. In 2021, this comprehensive undergraduate institution that once served all learners in the Central Alberta region, was converted into a regional polytechnic institute called Red Deer Polytechnic.When Red Deer had a college, that institution made an effort to maintain the sense of community that fosters learning with small class sizes, hands-on learning, and instructors who are accessible and interested in their students' success. Red Deer College's Arms, Supporters and Flag (both designed by Dr Darren George) were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on February 20, 2004. The college is a member of the Alberta Rural Development Network.In 2018, Red Deer College applied to begin transitioning to a university. The goal was to become a central hub of research and education for Central Alberta, offering world class education in the trades, the sciences, and the arts and fine arts.On March 5, 2019, the college announced a three-year transition process, and that it would adopt the name Red Deer University. On May 5, 2021, the Government of Alberta announced that Red Deer College would become a polytechnic institution instead of a university. Red Deer College has since announced that this transition is complete and they are no longer a comprehensive undergraduate institution. They are now a regional polytechnic Institute. "
