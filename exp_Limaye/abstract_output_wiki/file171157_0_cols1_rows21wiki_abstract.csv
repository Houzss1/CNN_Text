From Russia With Love  John Barry   ,"From Russia with Love is the soundtrack for the second James Bond film of the same name. This is the first series film with John Barry as the primary soundtrack composer.John Barry, arranger of Monty Norman's ""James Bond Theme"" for Dr. No, would be the dominant Bond series composer for most of its history and the inspiration for fellow series composer, David Arnold (who uses cues from this soundtrack in his own for Tomorrow Never Dies). The theme song was composed by Lionel Bart of Oliver! fame and sung by Matt Monro."
Goldfinger  John Barry   ,"Goldfinger is the soundtrack of the 1964 film of the same name, the third film in the James Bond film series, directed by Guy Hamilton. The album was composed by John Barry and distributed by EMI. Two versions were released initially, one in the United States and the United Kingdom, which varied in terms of length and which tracks were within the soundtrack. In 2003, Capitol-EMI records released a remastered version that contained all the tracks within the film."
Thunderball  John Barry   ,"Thunderball is the soundtrack album for the fourth James Bond film Thunderball.The album was first released by United Artists Records in 1965 in both monaural and stereo editions, with a CD release in 1988. The music was composed and conducted by John Barry, and performed by the John Barry Orchestra. This was Barry's third soundtrack for the series. The soundtrack was still being recorded when it came time for the album to be released, so the LP only featured twelve tracks from earlier in the film; an expanded edition with six bonus tracks was released for the first time when the album was reissued on Compact Disc on 25 February 2003 as part of the ""James Bond Remastered"" collection. Additionally, the music in the film was unfinished days before the film's release in theatres due to a late change by Eon Productions to use a title song with the same name as the film."
You Only Live Twice  John Barry   ,"You Only Live Twice is a 1967 spy film and the fifth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, who later directed the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me and the 1979 film Moonraker, both starring Roger Moore. The screenplay of You Only Live Twice was written by Roald Dahl, and loosely based on Ian Fleming's 1964 novel of the same name. It is the first James Bond film to discard most of Fleming's plot, using only a few characters and locations from the book as the background for an entirely new story.In the film, Bond is dispatched to Japan after American and Soviet crewed spacecraft disappear mysteriously in orbit, each nation blaming the other amidst the Cold War. Bond travels secretly to a remote Japanese island to find the perpetrators, and comes face-to-face with Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. The film reveals the appearance of Blofeld, who was previously a partially unseen character. SPECTRE is working for the government of an unnamed Asian power, implied to be the People's Republic of China, to provoke war between the superpowers.During the filming in Japan, it was announced that Sean Connery would retire from the role of Bond, but after one film's absence, he returned in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever and later 1983's non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again. You Only Live Twice was a great success, receiving positive reviews and grossing over $111 million in worldwide box office. However, the film was the first in the series to have a decline in box-office revenue owing to the over-saturation of the spy movie genre contributed to by the franchise's imitators, including the recent and poorly-received competing James Bond film, Casino Royale, from Columbia Pictures that was released previously in the same year."

Diamonds Are Forever  John Barry   ,"Diamonds Are Forever is the soundtrack by John Barry for the seventh James Bond film of the same name.""Diamonds Are Forever"", the title song with lyrics by Don Black, was the second Bond theme to be performed by Shirley Bassey, after ""Goldfinger"". The song was also recorded in Italian by Bassey as ""Una cascata di diamanti (Vivo di diamanti)"" for the Italian version's end credits; this version was only issued on 7-inch single in Italy, and was intended to be included in a (cancelled) 3-CD box set titled Shirley released in 2012."
Live And Let Die  George Martin   ,Live and Let Die is the soundtrack to the eighth James Bond film of the same name. It was scored by George Martin. The title song was written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Paul McCartney and Wings.It was the first Bond film score not to involve John Barry.
Man With The Golden Gun  John Barry   ,"The Man with the Golden Gun is a 1974 spy film and the ninth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, and the second to star Roger Moore as the fictional  MI6 agent James Bond. A loose adaptation of Ian Fleming's posthumously published 1965 novel of the same name, the film has Bond sent after the Solex Agitator, a breakthrough technological solution to contemporary energy shortages, while facing the assassin Francisco Scaramanga, the ""Man with the Golden Gun"". The action culminates in a duel between them that settles the fate of the Solex.The Man with the Golden Gun was the fourth and final film in the series directed by Guy Hamilton. The script was written by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz. The film was set in the face of the 1973 energy crisis, a dominant theme in the script. Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then-popular martial arts film craze, with several kung fu scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being set and shot in Thailand, Hong Kong, and Macau. Part of the film is also set in Beirut, Lebanon, but it was not shot there.The film was met with mixed reviews, and some critics described it as the lowest point in the canon up to that time. Christopher Lee's portrayal of Scaramanga as a villain of similar skill and ability to Bond was praised, but reviewers criticised the film as a whole, particularly its comedic approach and the performances of Moore and Britt Ekland. Whilst profitable, the film is the fourth lowest-grossing in the series, and its relatively modest returns by comparison with those of Live and Let Die (1973) reportedly placed the continuation of the franchise in jeopardy. It was the last Bond film to be co-produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, with Saltzman selling his 50% stake in Danjaq, LLC, the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film."

Moonraker  John Barry   ,"Moonraker is the soundtrack for the eleventh James Bond film of the same name.Moonraker was the third of the three Bond films for which the theme song was performed by Shirley Bassey. Frank Sinatra was considered for the vocals, before Johnny Mathis was approached and offered the opportunity. Mathis was unhappy about the song and withdrew from the project, leaving the producers scrambling for a replacement. Kate Bush declined as she was due to embark on her British tour, so John Barry offered the song to Bassey just weeks before the release date. As a result, Bassey made the recordings at very short notice and never regarded the song 'as her own' as she had never had the chance to perform it or promote it first. Indeed, Bassey has seldom performed the song live in comparison to her other two Bond themes, ""Goldfinger"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever"". The film uses two versions of the title theme song, a ballad version heard over the main titles, and a disco version for the end titles. Confusingly, the United Artists single release labelled the tracks on the 7"" single as ""Moonraker (Main Title)"" for the version used to close the film and ""Moonraker (End Title)"" for the track that opened the film. The song failed to make any real impact on the charts, which may partly be attributed to Bassey's failure to promote the single, given the last minute decision and the way in which it was quickly recorded to meet the schedule."
For Your Eyes Only  Bill Conti   ,"""For Your Eyes Only"" is the theme to the 12th James Bond movie of the same name, written by Bill Conti and Mike Leeson, and performed by Scottish singer Sheena Easton. The song reached number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, and number eight on the UK Singles Chart. It was nominated for Best Original Song at the Academy Awards in 1982."
Octopussy  John Barry   ,"Octopussy is a 1983 spy film and the thirteenth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions; it was the sixth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It was directed by John Glen and the screenplay was written by George MacDonald Fraser, Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson.The film's title is taken from a short story in Ian Fleming's 1966 short story collection Octopussy and The Living Daylights, although the film's plot is mostly original. It does, however, contain a scene adapted from the Fleming short story ""The Property of a Lady"" (included in 1967 and later editions of Octopussy and The Living Daylights). The events of the short story ""Octopussy"" form part of the title character's background and are recounted by her in the film.Bond is assigned the task of following a megalomaniacal Soviet general who is stealing jewellery and art objects from the Kremlin art repository. This leads Bond to a wealthy exiled Afghan prince, Kamal Khan, and his associate, Octopussy, and the discovery of a plot to force disarmament in Western Europe with the use of a nuclear weapon.Octopussy was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson; it was released four months before the non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again. The film earned $187.5 million against its $27.5 million budget and received mixed reviews. Praise was directed towards the action sequences and locations, with the plot and humour being targeted for criticism; Maud Adams' portrayal of the title character also drew polarised responses. It is the only Bond film omitted from Phil Hardy's Science Fiction (1996), explicitly because it is ""non-science fiction."""
The Living Daylights  John Barry   ,"The Living Daylights is a 1987 spy film, the fifteenth entry in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, and the first of two to star Timothy Dalton as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by John Glen, the film's title is taken from Ian Fleming's short story ""The Living Daylights"", the plot of which also forms the basis of the first act of the film. It was the last film to use the title of an Ian Fleming story until the 2006 instalment Casino Royale. The film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli, his stepson Michael G. Wilson, and co-produced by his daughter, Barbara Broccoli. The Living Daylights grossed $191.2 million worldwide, and received mixed reviews from critics."
Licence To Kill  Michael Kamen   ,"The soundtrack to Licence to Kill, the 16th Eon Productions James Bond film, was released by MCA Records in 1989.Because the usual James Bond composer John Barry (who had scored almost every film from From Russia with Love onwards) was not available at the time as he was undergoing throat surgery, the soundtrack's more upbeat and suspenseful score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen.Initially Eric Clapton and Vic Flick were asked to write and perform the theme song to Licence to Kill. The theme was said to have been a new version based on the ""James Bond Theme"". The guitar riff heard in the original recording of the theme was played by Flick.The prospect, however, fell apart and Gladys Knight's song and performance was chosen, later becoming a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. The song was composed by Narada Michael Walden, Jeffrey Cohen and Walter Afanasieff, based on the ""horn line"" from Goldfinger, which required royalty payments to the original writers. At 5 minutes 13 seconds it is the longest Bond theme, though 45 single releases featured a shorter edit, running 4 minutes 11 seconds. The music video of ""Licence to Kill"" was directed by Daniel Kleinman, who later took over the reins of title designer from Maurice Binder for the 1995 Bond film, GoldenEye.All the instrumental tracks are amalgams of various sequences and musical cues from the film rather than straight score excerpts. The end credits of the film feature the song ""If You Asked Me To"" sung by Patti LaBelle. Though the song was a top ten R&B charter and a minor pop hit for LaBelle, in 1992, the song was covered by and became a much bigger hit for singer Céline Dion. The track ""Wedding Party"", used during the wedding of Felix Leiter to Della Churchill, makes reference to the track ""Jump Up"" from the first Bond film, Dr. No."

GoldenEye  Eric Serra   ,"GoldenEye: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack from the United Artists film is the soundtrack to the 17th James Bond film of the same name and was composed by Éric Serra. It was released by EMI on November 14, 1995. Serra composed and performed a number of synthesizer tracks, including the radically reworked version of the James Bond Theme that plays during the gun barrel sequence, while John Altman and David Arch provided the more traditional symphonic music. The producers hired composer John Altman to write a more traditional, orchestral score piece for the tank-chase scene in St. Petersburg. Serra's original, unused track for that sequence can still be found on the soundtrack album as ""A Pleasant Drive in St. Petersburg"".The theme song ""GoldenEye"" was written by Bono and The Edge of rock band U2 and was performed by Tina Turner. The song was later covered by Nicole Scherzinger for the 2010 remake of the GoldenEye 007 video game.The Swedish pop band Ace of Base was also involved at one point, producing a different theme song—also called ""GoldenEye""—which does not appear in the film or soundtrack. This song was later released with slightly revised lyrics as ""The Juvenile"" on their 2002 album Da Capo, replacing the word ""GoldenEye"" with ""Juvenile"".The soundtrack does not feature the comedic rendition of the Tammy Wynette song ""Stand By Your Man"" from the film, which was sung by Minnie Driver.Starr Parodi composed a version of the James Bond Theme for the Goldeneye trailer."
Tomorrow Never Dies  David Arnold   ,"""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is a song by American singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow that serves as the theme song to the James Bond film of the same name.

The World Is Not Enough  David Arnold   ,"The World Is Not Enough is a 1999 spy film, the nineteenth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions and the third to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The film was directed by Michael Apted, with the original story and screenplay written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Bruce Feirstein. It was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The title is taken from the translation of the motto on the fictional Bond family coat of arms, seen first in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.The film's plot revolves around the assassination of billionaire Sir Robert King by the terrorist Renard, and Bond's subsequent assignment to protect King's daughter Elektra, who had previously been held for ransom by Renard. During his assignment, Bond unravels a scheme to increase petroleum prices by triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul.Filming locations included Spain, France, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and the UK, with interiors shot at Pinewood Studios. Despite receiving mixed reviews, with the plot and Denise Richards' casting being frequently targeted for criticism, The World Is Not Enough earned $361.8 million worldwide. It was also the first Eon-produced Bond film to be officially released under the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer label instead of United Artists, the original owner and distributor of the film franchise."

Die Another Day  David Arnold   ,"Die Another Day is a 2002 spy film and the twentieth film in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions. It was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and directed by Lee Tamahori. It is the fourth and final film to star Pierce Brosnan as MI6 agent James Bond; it was also the only film to have John Cleese as Q, and the last with Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny. Halle Berry co-stars as NSA agent Giacinta ""Jinx""  Johnson, the Bond girl. The plot follows Bond as he attempts to locate a mole in British intelligence who betrayed him and a British billionaire who is later revealed to be connected to a North Korean operative that he seemingly killed. It is an original story, although it takes influence from Ian Fleming's novels Moonraker (1955) and The Man with the Golden Gun (1965).Die Another Day marked the James Bond franchise's 40th anniversary; consequently, the film includes references to each of the preceding films. The film received mixed reviews; some critics praised Tamahori's direction, but many disliked its over-reliance on CGI, product placement and its unoriginal plot, as well as the villain. Nevertheless, Die Another Day was the highest-grossing James Bond film up to that time unadjusted for inflation."
