2000 Dark Tide II : Ruin Michael Stackpole ,"Star Wars: The New Jedi Order (or New Jedi Order or NJO) is a series of 19 science fiction novels, published from 1999 to 2003, set in the Star Wars Expanded Universe. The series revolves around the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy 21–25 years after the events depicted in Return of the Jedi. The New Jedi Order was the restored and reformed Jedi organization, following the Great Jedi Purge and subsequent fall of the Galactic Empire. The Jedi Knights, reduced in number to only a handful, were slowly restored, primarily under the leadership of Luke Skywalker. Additional related stories were published, some as e-book novellas (as recently as 2006) and others as comic books (as recent as 2010/2011); these increase the total number of published NJO-related stories to 26.Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, in 2014, most existing Star Wars spin-off works—including those related to The New Jedi Order—were declared non-canon and rebranded as 'Legends'."
