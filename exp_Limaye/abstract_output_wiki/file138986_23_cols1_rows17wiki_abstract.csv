"Jewish Press Brooklyn , New York ","Brooklyn () is a borough of New York City, coextensive with Kings County, in the U.S. state of New York. It is the most populous county in New York State, as well as the second-most densely populated county in the United States (after New York County). It is also New York City's most populous borough, with 2,736,074 residents in 2020. If each borough were ranked as a city, Brooklyn would rank as the third-most populous in the U.S., after Los Angeles and Chicago.Named after the Dutch village of Breukelen, it shares a land border with the borough of Queens, on the western end of Long Island. Brooklyn has several bridge and tunnel connections to the borough of Manhattan across the East River and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge connects it with Staten Island. With a land area of 70.82 square miles (183.4 km2) and a water area of 26 square miles (67 km2), Kings County is New York state's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area.Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city (and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the New York State Constitution) until January 1, 1898, when, after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s, according to the new Municipal Charter of ""Greater New York,"" Brooklyn was consolidated with other cities, towns, and counties, to form the modern City of New York, surrounding the Upper New York Bay with five constituent boroughs. The borough continues, however, to maintain a distinct culture. Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves. Brooklyn's official motto, displayed on the Borough seal and flag, is Eendraght Maeckt Maght, which translates from early modern Dutch as ""Unity makes strength.""In the first decades of the 21st century, Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as a destination for hipsters, with concomitant gentrification, dramatic house price increases, and a decrease in housing affordability. Some new developments are required to include affordable housing units. Since the 2010s, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship, high technology start-up firms, postmodern art and design."

"Norway Times - Nordisk Tidende Brooklyn , New York ","Nordisk Tidende was a Norwegian language newspaper in the United States founded in 1891 and closed in 1983. In 1996, the Norwegian investment company that owned the Norway Times wanted to sell it, but the employees purchased the paper to keep it alive. The paper continued to serve its readers for another decade before it merged with Western Viking and the resulting publication became The Norwegian American in 2006. Some also report a daughter publication that opened in 1993 known as the Nordic Journal.The newspaper was founded by Emil Nilsen, an immigrant who came to the United States in 1887 to seek his fortune. As a previous book printer and sense of newspaper operations, it was natural that he started a newspaper for Norwegians in their new homeland. He saw that there was a need for Norwegians in the New York area to receive news from ""the Old Country"" written in Norwegian and decided to start Nordisk Tidende. Its first edition released 3 January 1891.In order to capture readers' interest, Nilsen filled his newspaper with drug rumors, scandals and popular gossip. His successors imposed a higher standard and more professional journalism, and the newspaper evolved into a respected publication that could offer their readers cultural fabric and news from two continents.In 1930, Brooklyn had 63,000 residents of Norwegian descent. The newspaper was their main source of news from Norway, but World War II heightened the importance of the newspaper to its readership.Nordisk Tidende was the only free Norwegian newspaper published during World War II and the only uncensored newspaper with the latest news from occupied Norway. Among the newspaper's writers at the time were Nobel Prize winner Sigrid Undset.As time passed and the first and second generation Norwegians died out, there was less need for a Norwegian language newspaper. The newspaper changed its name in 1991 to Norway Times and became an English-language weekly newspaper.Nordisk Tidende had several editors over the years. Carl Søyland, among others, joined the newspaper in 1930 and was its editor from 1940 to 1963.Norway Times' current editor is from Stavanger, Lene Heimlund Larsen."

"The Buffalo News Buffalo , New York ","Buffalo is the second-largest city in the U.S. state of New York and the seat of Erie County. It is located at the eastern end of Lake Erie, adjacent to the Canadian border with Southern Ontario, and is at the head of the Niagara River. With a population of 278,348, according to the 2020 census, Buffalo is the 76th-largest city in the United States. The city and nearby Niagara Falls share the two-county Buffalo–Niagara Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The MSA had an estimated population of 1.1 million in 2020, making it the 49th largest MSA in the United States. The Western New York region containing Buffalo is the largest population and economic center between Boston, Massachusetts and Cleveland, Ohio.Before French exploration, the region was inhabited by nomadic Paleo-Indians, and later, the Neutral, Erie, and Iroquois nations. In the 18th century, Iroquois land surrounding Buffalo Creek was ceded through the Holland Land Purchase, and a small village was established at its headwaters. Buffalo was selected as the terminus of the Erie Canal in 1825 after improving its harbor, which led to its incorporation in 1832. The canal stimulated its growth as the primary inland port between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. Transshipment made Buffalo the world's largest grain port. After railroads superseded the canal's importance, the city became the largest railway hub after Chicago. Buffalo transitioned to manufacturing during the mid-19th century, later dominated by steel production. Deindustrialization and the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway saw the city's economy decline, diversifying to service industries such as health care, retail, tourism, logistics, and education while retaining some manufacturing. The gross domestic product of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls MSA was $53 billion in 2019.The city's cultural icons include the oldest urban parks system in the United States, the Albright–Knox Art Gallery, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, Shea's Performing Arts Center, the Buffalo Museum of Science, and several annual festivals. Its educational institutions include the University at Buffalo, Buffalo State College, Canisius College, D'Youville College and Medaille College. Buffalo is also known for its winter weather, Buffalo wings, and two major-league sports teams: the National Football League's Buffalo Bills and the National Hockey League's Buffalo Sabres."
