Con Mine 1938 - 2003 gold,"The Con Mine (1938-2003) was the first gold mine developed in the Northwest Territories, Canada, just south of Yellowknife. The property was staked by Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada (Cominco) in September 1935 in response to the discovery of visible gold nearby; the name ""Con"" is an abbreviation of ""Consolidated"". The advent of winter prevented any prospecting from being conducted, but work in the summer of 1936 led to the discovery of numerous gold veins. The Con Mine entered production in 1938 and ceased operations in 2003. It has produced over 5,000,000 ozt (160,000 kg) of gold from 12,195,585 tons of ore processed. The mine was over 6,000 ft (1,800 m) deep.Owners of the mine have included Cominco (1938–1986), Nerco Minerals (1986–1993), Miramar Mining Corp. (1993–2008), and Newmont Mining Corp. (2008–present).Geologically, the Con Mine is located within the Kam Group which is part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt."
Giant Mine 1948 - 2004 gold,"The Giant Mine was a gold mine located on the Ingraham Trail, 5 km (3.1 mi) north of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Giant Mine is within the Kam Group, which is part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt. Gold was discovered on the property and mineral claims staked in 1935 by Johnny Baker, but the true extent of the gold deposits was not known until 1944, when a massive gold-bearing shear zone was uncovered beneath the drift-filled Baker Creek Valley."
"Ptarmigan and Tom Mine 1941 - 1942 , 1985 - 1997 gold","The Ptarmigan and Tom Mine were gold producers located in the Northwest Territories, Canada at Yellowknife. The property was staked by prospectors in 1936 and acquired by Cominco in 1938. The mine first produced between 1941 and 1942 but closed due to wartime restrictions. The old property was demolished in 1969–1970. A new company, Treminco Resources Limited, reopened the workings in 1985 and production from the Tom (62°31′57″N 114°11′41″W) portal began in 1986 with material being trucked to Giant Mine. The old Ptarmigan (62°31′15″N 114°11′45″W) mine shaft was dewatered and production began in 1987. A new mill was built at the property and was operational in July 1989. Low gold prices forced the company to close the mines in 1997. Total gold production has been approximately 120,000 troy ounces (130,000 oz; 3,700,000 g).On February 2, 2010, Trivello Energy Corp., a publicly traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada under the trading symbol ""TRV"", announced it had acquired the Tom Gold Mine project including five claims of approximately 650 acres (260 ha).Trivello Energy Corp. changed its name to Equitas Resources Corp. and trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the trading symbol ""EQT""."
Negus Mine 1939 - 1952 gold,"Negus Mine was a gold producer at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, from 1939 to 1952. It produced 255,807 troy ounces (7956 kg) of gold from 490,808 tons of ore milled. The underground workings were acquired by adjacent Con Mine in 1953 and were used for ventilation purposes until Con Mine closed in 2003."
Burwash Mine 1935 gold,"The Burwash Mine was a small gold property discovered in the fall of 1934 by Johnny Baker and Hugh Muir at Yellowknife Bay, Northwest Territories. The town of Yellowknife did not exist yet at that point, but the discovery of gold at Burwash was the catalyst that brought more gold prospectors into the region in 1935 and 1936. A short shaft was sunk in 1935–1936 at Burwash, and in the summer of 1935 a 16-ton bulk sample of ore was shipped to Trail, British Columbia for processing, yielding 200 troy ounces (6 kg) of gold. The mine did not become a substantial producer and it is believed the gold vein was mined out.  The Burwash Mine has some historical significance in that the original ore sample kept ""gold fever"" alive in the area and helped in the establishment of Yellowknife as a viable northern community."

Discovery Mine 1950 - 1969 gold,"The Discovery Mine was a gold mine 84 kilometers northeast (approx bearing of 15 degrees) of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories that operated between 1950 and 1969. Gold was discovered here by Alfred Giauque in 1944. A complete townsite, on Giauque Lake, was established by the company to house workers and their families. The mine produced one million troy ounces (31,000 kg) of gold from one million tons of ore. The abandoned townsite, not accessible by road, was demolished in 2005.Discovery Mine was serviced by air and had an unpaved airstrip to fly people and supplies in and out. After the mine was abandoned, the airstrip was often used by flying instructors from Yellowknife to teach their students emergency landing procedures on abandoned airstrips. As late as the early 1980s, the airstrip was in sufficiently good shape to use, with only a few potholes even after more than ten years. An aerial view of the lake at that time showed it to be crystal clear, with an unobstructed view to the rocky bottom and a beautiful blue colour. A tailings spill in the early 1960s deposited contaminated waste into the Lake. The short-life cyanide was undetectable within a few years, but the residual mercury remained in the sediment and entered the food chain. Declining concentrations of mercury in the fish since 1975 has occurred as the contaminated wastes are naturally buried. Clean-up of the townsite and tailings concluded in 2005 with no detectable contaminants in Giauque Lake water.  Continuous monitoring since then continues to report no detectable contamination of the waters.Additional mineralization discovered in 1994 led to renewed development of the area. Tyhee Development Corp of Vancouver, B.C. planned to exploit the over 1 million ounces of gold identified on site.  In 2010 Tyhee (renamed Tyhee Gold Corp) completed a Preliminary Feasibility Study reporting 2.2 million ounces of gold in five zones, two of which are contiguous with the Discovery Mine.  In 2011 Tyhee advanced their permitting of a new mine to the Developers Assessment Report stage of the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review process.  A Feasibility Study completed in 2012 reported positive economics from a combined mining operation exploiting Reserves identified on the Discovery Mine Property, and two other satellite zones.  A central milling site at the Discovery Mine was proposed.  Tyhee became insolvent and in 2017 they voluntarily entered receivership and all of its assets were purchased by GoldMining Inc. of Vancouver."
"Camlaren Mine 1962 - 1963 , 1980 - 1981 gold",None
Beaulieu Mine 1947 - 1948 gold,"The Beaulieu Mine was a post-World War II gold mining operation near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. It entered production in October 1947 but by the end of November only 7 troy ounces (220 g) of rough gold were recovered. Additional gold was recovered during 1948, but the mine recovered only 30 troy ounces (930g) of fine gold altogether. The operation folded in chaos and bankruptcy."
"Outpost Island Mine 1941 - 1942 , 1951 - 1952 gold , copper , tungsten","The Outpost Island Mine was a gold and tungsten producer 94 kilometres southeast of  Yellowknife, Northwest Territories on an island of Great Slave Lake. Gold was discovered here in 1935 by prospectors, and some development was undertaken in 1936–1938. Tungsten ores became valuable during World War II, so the owners (Slave Lake Gold Mines Limited) investigated the tungsten possibilities of the mine. It produced small amounts of gold, copper, and tungsten during 1941–1942, and then again in 1951-1952 during the Korean War. It was a small deposit and was not considered economic because of unpredictable tungsten market prices in the 1950s."
"Ruth Mine 1942 , 1959 gold","Yellowknife (; Dogrib: Sǫǫ̀mbak’è) is the capital, largest community, and only city in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River.Yellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe, who were known as the ""Copper Indians"" or ""Yellowknife Indians"", today incorporated as the Yellowknives Dene First Nation. They traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is ethnically mixed, was 19,569 per the 2016 Canadian Census. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as Sǫ̀mbak'è (Som-ba Kay) (""where the money is""). Modern Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily Indigenous communities of Ndilǫ and Dettah.The Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until 1936. Yellowknife quickly became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also emerged as significant Yellowknife industries."
