1990 May Windows 3 . 0   ,"Windows 3.0 is the third major release of Microsoft Windows, launched in 1990.  It features a new graphical user interface (GUI) where applications are represented as clickable icons, as opposed to the list of file names seen in its predecessors. Later updates would expand the software's capabilities, one of which added multimedia support for sound recording and playback, as well as support for CD-ROMs.Windows 3.0 is the first version of Windows to perform well both critically and commercially. Critics and users considered its GUI to be a challenger to those of Apple Macintosh and Unix. Other praised features were the improved multitasking, customizability, and especially the utilitarian management of computer memory that troubled the users of Windows 3.0's predecessors. Microsoft was criticized by third-party developers for the bundling of its separate software with the operating environment, which they viewed as an anticompetitive practice. Windows 3.0 sold 10 million copies before it was succeeded by Windows 3.1 in 1992.On December 31, 2001, Microsoft declared Windows 3.0 obsolete and stopped providing support and updates for the system."

1998 June Windows 98   ,"Windows 98 is an operating system developed by Microsoft as part of its Windows 9x family of Microsoft Windows operating systems. It is the successor to Windows 95, and was released to manufacturing on May 15, 1998, and generally to retail on June 25, 1998. Like its predecessor, it is a hybrid 16-bit and 32-bit monolithic product with the boot stage based on MS-DOS.Windows 98 is a heavily web-integrated operating system that bears numerous similarities to its predecessor. It heavily relies on the HTML language. Most of the improvements are cosmetic or designed to improve the user experience, but there are a handful of features that enhance system functionality and capabilities. These include improved USB support and accessibility, as well as support for hardware advancements such as DVD players. It was the first Windows operating system to adopt the Windows Driver Model. It also introduced features that would become standard in future generations of Windows, such as Disk Cleanup, Windows Update, multi-monitor support, and Internet Connection Sharing.Microsoft had marketed Windows 98 as a ""tune-up"" to Windows 95, rather than an entirely improved next generation of Windows. Upon release, it was generally well received for its web-integrated interface and ease of use, as well as for addressing issues that had been present in Windows 95, though users had pointed out that it was not significantly more stable than its predecessor. It saw one major update called Windows 98 Second Edition (SE) on May 5, 1999, and was succeeded by Windows Me in 2000. It sold an estimated 58 million licenses, and Microsoft ended mainstream support for both Windows 98 and 98 SE on June 30, 2002, and ended extended support on July 11, 2006."

2000 June Windows Millennium Edition ( Me )   ,"Windows Millennium Edition, or Windows Me (marketed with the pronunciation of the pronoun ""me""), is an operating system produced by Microsoft as part of the Windows 9x family of Microsoft Windows operating systems. It was the direct successor to Windows 98, and was released to manufacturing on June 19, 2000, with retail sales beginning on September 14, 2000. It was Microsoft's operating system for home users until the introduction of Windows XP in 2001.Windows Me was targeted specifically at home PC users and included Internet Explorer 5.5, Windows Media Player 7, and the new Windows Movie Maker software, which provided basic video editing and was designed to be easy to use for home users. Microsoft also incorporated features first introduced in Windows 2000, which had been released as a business-oriented operating system seven months earlier, into the graphical user interface, shell, and Windows Explorer. Although Windows Me was still ultimately based around MS-DOS like its predecessors, access to real-mode MS-DOS was restricted to decrease system boot time.Windows Me was initially positively received, but its reception became more negative as time went on, to the point that it was heavily panned by users due to stability issues. Retrospectively, Windows Me is viewed as one of the worst operating systems Microsoft has ever produced. In October 2001, Windows XP was released to the public, having already been under development at the time of Windows Me's release, and popularized most of Windows Me's features, while being far more stable. Extended support for Windows Me ended on July 11, 2006."
