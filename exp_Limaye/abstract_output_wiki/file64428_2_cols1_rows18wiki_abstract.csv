Con Mine 1938 - 2003 gold,"The Con Mine (1938-2003) was the first gold mine developed in the Northwest Territories, Canada, just south of Yellowknife. The property was staked by Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada (Cominco) in September 1935 in response to the discovery of visible gold nearby; the name ""Con"" is an abbreviation of ""Consolidated"". The advent of winter prevented any prospecting from being conducted, but work in the summer of 1936 led to the discovery of numerous gold veins. The Con Mine entered production in 1938 and ceased operations in 2003. It has produced over 5,000,000 ozt (160,000 kg) of gold from 12,195,585 tons of ore processed. The mine was over 6,000 ft (1,800 m) deep.Owners of the mine have included Cominco (1938–1986), Nerco Minerals (1986–1993), Miramar Mining Corp. (1993–2008), and Newmont Mining Corp. (2008–present).Geologically, the Con Mine is located within the Kam Group which is part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt."
Giant Mine 1948 - 2004 gold,"The Giant Mine was a gold mine located on the Ingraham Trail, 5 km (3.1 mi) north of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Giant Mine is within the Kam Group, which is part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt. Gold was discovered on the property and mineral claims staked in 1935 by Johnny Baker, but the true extent of the gold deposits was not known until 1944, when a massive gold-bearing shear zone was uncovered beneath the drift-filled Baker Creek Valley."
"Ptarmigan and Tom Mine 1941 - 1942 , 1986 - 1997 gold","The Ptarmigan and Tom Mine were gold producers located in the Northwest Territories, Canada at Yellowknife. The property was staked by prospectors in 1936 and acquired by Cominco in 1938. The mine first produced between 1941 and 1942 but closed due to wartime restrictions. The old property was demolished in 1969–1970. A new company, Treminco Resources Limited, reopened the workings in 1985 and production from the Tom (62°31′57″N 114°11′41″W) portal began in 1986 with material being trucked to Giant Mine. The old Ptarmigan (62°31′15″N 114°11′45″W) mine shaft was dewatered and production began in 1987. A new mill was built at the property and was operational in July 1989. Low gold prices forced the company to close the mines in 1997. Total gold production has been approximately 120,000 troy ounces (130,000 oz; 3,700,000 g).On February 2, 2010, Trivello Energy Corp., a publicly traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada under the trading symbol ""TRV"", announced it had acquired the Tom Gold Mine project including five claims of approximately 650 acres (260 ha).Trivello Energy Corp. changed its name to Equitas Resources Corp. and trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the trading symbol ""EQT""."
Negus Mine 1939 - 1952 gold,"Negus Mine was a gold producer at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, from 1939 to 1952. It produced 255,807 troy ounces (7956 kg) of gold from 490,808 tons of ore milled. The underground workings were acquired by adjacent Con Mine in 1953 and were used for ventilation purposes until Con Mine closed in 2003."
"Thompson - Lundmark Mine 1941 - 1943 , 1947 - 1949 gold",None
Discovery Mine 1950 - 1969 gold,"The Discovery Mine was a gold mine 84 kilometers northeast (approx bearing of 15 degrees) of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories that operated between 1950 and 1969. Gold was discovered here by Alfred Giauque in 1944. A complete townsite, on Giauque Lake, was established by the company to house workers and their families. The mine produced one million troy ounces (31,000 kg) of gold from one million tons of ore. The abandoned townsite, not accessible by road, was demolished in 2005.Discovery Mine was serviced by air and had an unpaved airstrip to fly people and supplies in and out. After the mine was abandoned, the airstrip was often used by flying instructors from Yellowknife to teach their students emergency landing procedures on abandoned airstrips. As late as the early 1980s, the airstrip was in sufficiently good shape to use, with only a few potholes even after more than ten years. An aerial view of the lake at that time showed it to be crystal clear, with an unobstructed view to the rocky bottom and a beautiful blue colour. A tailings spill in the early 1960s deposited contaminated waste into the Lake. The short-life cyanide was undetectable within a few years, but the residual mercury remained in the sediment and entered the food chain. Declining concentrations of mercury in the fish since 1975 has occurred as the contaminated wastes are naturally buried. Clean-up of the townsite and tailings concluded in 2005 with no detectable contaminants in Giauque Lake water.  Continuous monitoring since then continues to report no detectable contamination of the waters.Additional mineralization discovered in 1994 led to renewed development of the area. Tyhee Development Corp of Vancouver, B.C. planned to exploit the over 1 million ounces of gold identified on site.  In 2010 Tyhee (renamed Tyhee Gold Corp) completed a Preliminary Feasibility Study reporting 2.2 million ounces of gold in five zones, two of which are contiguous with the Discovery Mine.  In 2011 Tyhee advanced their permitting of a new mine to the Developers Assessment Report stage of the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review process.  A Feasibility Study completed in 2012 reported positive economics from a combined mining operation exploiting Reserves identified on the Discovery Mine Property, and two other satellite zones.  A central milling site at the Discovery Mine was proposed.  Tyhee became insolvent and in 2017 they voluntarily entered receivership and all of its assets were purchased by GoldMining Inc. of Vancouver."

"Eldorado Mine 1933 - 1940 , 1942 - 1960 , 1976 - 1982 radium , uranium , silver , copper","The Northwest Territories (commonly abbreviated as NT or NWT; French: Territoires du Nord-Ouest) is a federal territory of Canada. At a land area of approximately 1,144,000 km2 (442,000 sq mi) and a 2016 census population of 41,790, it is the second-largest and the most populous of the three territories in Northern Canada. Its estimated population as of 2021 is 45,504. Yellowknife is the capital, most populous community, and only city in the territory; its population was 19,569 as of the 2016 census. It became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the Carrothers Commission.The Northwest Territories, a portion of the old North-Western Territory, entered the Canadian Confederation on July 15, 1870. Since then, the territory has been divided four times to create new provinces and territories or enlarge existing ones. Its current borders date from April 1, 1999, when the territory's size was decreased again by the creation of a new territory of Nunavut to the east, through the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. While Nunavut is mostly Arctic tundra, the Northwest Territories has a slightly warmer climate and is both boreal forest (taiga) and tundra, and its most northern regions form part of the Arctic Archipelago.The Northwest Territories is bordered by Canada's two other territories, Nunavut to the east and Yukon to the west, and by the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan to the south, and may touch Manitoba to the southeast (historic surveys being uncertain) at a quadripoint including Nunavut and Saskatchewan. The land area of the Northwest Territories is vast enough to be roughly equal to France, Portugal and Spain combined, although its overall area is even larger courtesy of its vast lakes that freeze over in winter."
Echo Bay Mine 1964 - 1975 silver and copper,"Echo Bay Mines Limited was a Canadian company which was organized in 1964 by Northwest Explorers Limited to develop a silver deposit at Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, which had been staked in 1930 by The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company.  The company leased the old Port Radium settlement from Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited and used the old camp and mill to recover silver and copper values from what became known as the Echo Bay Mine. Production in the Echo Bay workings ceased in 1975. The company then reopened the old Eldorado Mine workings and produced more silver and copper until 1981 when low silver prices closed the mine for good.Echo Bay Mines Limited went on to open a new gold mine by that point, Lupin Mine, in what was then the Northwest Territories and is today in Nunavut. It entered production in 1982.Echo Bay Mines Limited developed numerous other properties, mostly in the United States, including two mines in Nevada, McCoy/Cove and Round Mountain gold mine, and the Kettle River mine in Washington. Corporate headquarters were in Englewood Colorado.In 1986 the company purchased Sunnyside Gold Mine in Silverton, Colorado, and operated it for five years before it closed because of low gold prices.The company became a subsidiary of Kinross Gold Corporation in 2003 and has been delisted from the stock exchange."
Ekati Diamond Mine 1998 - current diamonds,"The Ekati Diamond Mine (""Ekati"") is Canada's first surface and underground diamond mine. It is located 310 km (190 mi) north-east of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, and about 200 km (120 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, near Lac de Gras. Until 2014 Ekati was a joint venture between Dominion Diamond Mines (80%), and the two geologists who discovered kimberlite pipes north of Lac de Gras, Chuck Fipke and Stewart Blusson each holding a 10% stake in the mine, until Fipke sold his share to Dominion."

It produced lead and zinc ores from a Mississippi Valley Type deposit between 1964 and 1988. Most of the mining was done by  open-pit methods. The town of Pine Point was built by the mining company, Cominco, and when the mine closed the town was abandoned and demolished."
"Cantung Mine 1962 - 1986 , 2002 - 2003 tungsten","Cantung Mine is a tungsten producer in the Nahanni area of the Northwest Territories, Canada, located northeast of Watson Lake in the Flat River Valley of the Selwyn Range close to the Yukon border. Tungsten was originally discovered in the area in 1954 by prospectors. Cantung Mine operated from 1962 to 1986, again from 2002 to 2003, and from 2005. Production was suspended from October 2009 to October 2010. The mine owner, North American Tungsten Corporation, went bankrupt in 2015 and the mine closed in October of that year. The federal government of Canada now owns the mine and has to clean up the site.  As of December, 2017, the mine remained closed, with the possibility of being opened to process a nearby lithium deposit.As of February 2019, the mine is still closed; the federal and NWT governments are trying to sell it."
Rayrock Mine 1957 - 1959 uranium,"The Rayrock Mine was a uranium producing venture in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is located on the south side of Maryleer Lake and the north shore of Fault Lake, 169 kilometers northwest of Yellowknife and 74 kilometres northwest of Rae. Radioactive deposits were originally staked in 1948 and then restaked in 1950. American Yellowknife Mines Limited explored the site with detailed Geiger surveys and extensive trenching in the early 1950s. In 1954 exploration work included over 10,000 feet (3,000 m) of surface diamond drilling, and the company was reorganized as Rayrock Mines Limited.Underground development began in 1955 with the driving of a long adit tunnel to intersect the radioactive zones 300 feet (91 m) below surface. The mine opened in June 1957 with a 150 tons per day leaching mill. Development was expanded and the mine reached depths of 1,000 feet (300 m) by the end of 1957. The failure to locate ore in significant quantity below the 1,000-foot (300 m) level resulted in the cessation of mining on July 31, 1959.During the operations at Rayrock Mine, an on-site mill facility processed 78,781 short tons of uranium ore yielding 458,020 pounds of uranium concentrate. Rayrock Mine was a fully underground uranium mine with a small townsite built by the company being in operation during this period. The mine employed 135 men in 1958 and the townsite had 20 families as residents. The mining facility and town existed in an abandoned state for over twenty years after the mine closed.In 1987, the buildings of the mine and town were demolished. Environmental cleanup began in 1996, with the objective being to contain contaminants at the site and limit exposure to persons who visit the area. Remediation activities included sealing mine openings, removing radioactive material from the dump, disposing of this contaminated material on the tailings, and capping the tailings piles with a layer of silty clay, followed by revegetation."

"Colomac Mine 1990 - 1992 , 1994 - 1997 gold","The Colomac Mine was a privately owned and operated open pit gold mine located 220 km northwest of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories in Canada . The Colomac mine operated between 1990–1992, and 1994–1997. It was operated by Neptune Resources Limited that had little success in making a profit during its operation. In 1994, the mine had reopened under Royal Oak Mines Inc. Both Neptune Resources and Royal Oak Mines where both owned and operated by Peggy Witte.  Due to low gold prices and high cost of mining, Royal Oak Mines was forced into bankruptcy. The Federal Government of Canada became owners of the mine, along with the related environmental issues. A major cleanup effort is under way to prevent the mine from polluting the environment, but this might be too late at this stage.  This mine is now owned and controlled by the Indigenous and Northern Affairs department of the Federal government, while Public Works and Government services is the current contracting authority."
