Alexander Campbell July 1 1867 November 7 1873 ,"The First Canadian Ministry was the first cabinet chaired by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald.  It governed Canada from 1 July 1867 to 5 November 1873, including all of the 1st Canadian Parliament as well as the first eight months of the Second.  The government was formed by the Liberal-Conservative Party in coalition with the old Conservative Party of Canada.  Macdonald was also Prime Minister in the Third Canadian Ministry."
Luc Letellier de St - Just November 7 1873 December 14 1876 ,"The Third Legislature of Quebec was the provincial legislature of Quebec, Canada from 1875 to 1878, following the general election of 1875.In the 1875 election, Premier Charles Boucher de Boucherville and the Conservative Party of Quebec won a majority in the Legislative Assembly and continued in office with a majority government. However, in 1878, de Boucherville was dismissed from office by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Luc Letellier de Saint-Just, who appointed Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party as premier.Joly de Lotbinière formed a minority government.  It was the first time the Liberals were in office since Quebec had been created in 1867, and the first minority government in Quebec's history. Lotbinière immediately called a general election due to the minority status of his government.The Legislature held three annual sessions, with the first session called on November 4, 1875. The Legislature was dissolved on March 22, 1878, leading to the 1878 general election on May 1, 1878."

Alexander Campbell October 18 1878 January 26 1887 ,"The  Treasurer of New South Wales, known from 1856 to 1959 as the Colonial Treasurer of New South Wales, is the minister in the Government of New South Wales responsible for government expenditure and revenue raising and is the head of the New South Wales Treasury. The Treasurer plays a key role in the economic policy of the government.The current Treasurer, since 5 October 2021 is The Honourable Matt Kean . The Treasurer is assisted in his portfolio, also since 5 October 2021, by the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Minister for Jobs, Investment, Tourism and Western Sydney, currently The Hon. Stuart Ayres ; and the Minister for Finance and Small Business, currently The Hon. Damien Tudehope MLC. Ayres and Tudehope were appointed with effect from 2 April 2019.Each year, the Treasurer presents the NSW Budget to the Parliament. In some other countries the equivalent role is the Minister for Finance, although NSW has had a separate office of that name responsible for regulating government spending. For 103 years the Treasurer was originally known as the 'Colonial Treasurer', however the 'Colonial' word was removed with the passing of the Ministers of the Crown Act 1959 (NSW) from 1 April 1959.Treasurers Forster, Stuart, Dibbs, Jennings, Reid, Lyne, Waddell, Carruthers, McGowen, Holman, Fuller, Lang, Bavin, Stevens, Mair, McKell, McGirr, Cahill, Heffron, Renshaw, Askin, Lewis, Willis, Wran, Greiner, Fahey and Iemma were also Premier during some or all of their period as Treasurer.

Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott May 12 1887 October 30 1893 ,"Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott  (March 12, 1821 – October 30, 1893) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the third prime minister of Canada from 1891 to 1892. He held office as the leader of the Conservative Party.Abbott was born in what is now Saint-André-d'Argenteuil, Quebec. He studied law at McGill University and became one of Montreal's best-known lawyers, later returning to McGill as a professor of law and earning a Doctor of Civil Law degree. He was perhaps best known for his successful defence of the perpetrators of the St. Albans Raid. Abbott involved himself in politics from a young age, signing the Montreal Annexation Manifesto in 1849 – which he later regretted – and winning election to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1860. In the lead-up to Confederation he was a prominent advocate for the rights of English-speaking Quebecers.In the 1867 federal election, Abbott was elected to the new House of Commons of Canada as a member of the Conservative Party. A telegram leaked from his office played a key part in the Pacific Scandal of 1873, which led to the downfall of John A. Macdonald's first government. Abbott was appointed to the Senate in 1887, in order to become Leader of the Government in the Senate. He became prime minister in June 1891 following Macdonald's death in office.  He was the first native-born Canadian prime minister, both Macdonald and Alexander Mackenzie having been born in Scotland. Abbott was 70 years old at the time, and served only until November 1892 when he retired due to ill health. He died the following year."
Sir Mackenzie Bowell October 31 1893 April 27 1896 ,"Sir Mackenzie Bowell  (; December 27, 1823 – December 10, 1917) was a Canadian newspaper publisher and politician, who served as the fifth prime minister of Canada, in office from 1894 to 1896.Bowell was born in Rickinghall, Suffolk, England. He and his family moved to Belleville, Ontario, in 1832. His mother died two years after their arrival. When in his early teens, Bowell was apprenticed to the printing shop of the local newspaper, the Belleville Intelligencer, and some 15 years later, became its owner and proprietor.In 1867, following Confederation, he was elected to the House of Commons for the Conservative Party. Bowell entered cabinet in 1878, and would serve under three prime ministers: John A. Macdonald, John Abbott, and John Thompson. He served variously as Minister of Customs (1878–1892), Minister of Militia and Defence (1892), and Minister of Trade and Commerce (1892–1894). Bowell kept his Commons seat continuously for 25 years, through a period of Liberal Party rule in the 1870s. In 1892, Bowell was appointed to the Senate. He became Leader of the Government in the Senate the following year.In December 1894, Prime Minister Thompson unexpectedly died in office, aged only 49. The Earl of Aberdeen, Canada's governor general, appointed Bowell to replace Thompson as prime minister, due to his status as the most senior cabinet member. The main problem of Bowell's tenure as prime minister was the Manitoba Schools Question. His attempts at compromise alienated members of his own party, and following a Cabinet revolt in early 1896 he was forced to resign in favour of Charles Tupper. Bowell stayed on as a senator until his death at the age of 93, but never again held ministerial office; he served continuously as a Canadian parliamentarian for 50 years."
Sir Oliver Mowat August 19 1896 November 18 1897 ,"Sir Oliver Mowat,  (July 22, 1820 – April 19, 1903) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, and Liberal Party leader. He served for nearly 24 years as the third premier of Ontario. He was the eighth lieutenant governor of Ontario and one of the Fathers of Confederation. He is best known for defending successfully the constitutional rights of the provinces in the face of the centralizing tendency of the national government as represented by his longtime conservative adversary, John A. Macdonald. This longevity and power was due to his political maneuvering, in terms of building a political base around Liberals, Catholics, trade unions, and anti-French-Canadian sentiment.Despite years of public service, Mowat never achieved the fame and public attention of his conservative rival John A. Macdonald who sought to outmaneuver him during their public life. Their personal relationship and political competition has become one of the foremost examples of political rivalry in Canadian politics."

Raoul Dandurand September 25 1926 August 6 1930 ,"William Lyon Mackenzie King  (December 17, 1874 – July 22, 1950) was a Canadian statesman and politician who served as the 10th prime minister of Canada for three non-consecutive terms from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930 and 1935 to 1948. A Liberal, he was the dominant politician in Canada during both the interwar period and World War II, from the 1920s through the 1940s. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (1939–1945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining morale on the home front. With a total of 21 years and 154 days in office, he remains the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was ""Help those that cannot help themselves""), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state.Born in Kitchener, Ontario, King entered the House of Commons in 1908 before acceding to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1919, following the death of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Taking the helm of a party bitterly torn apart during the First World War due to the Conscription Crisis of 1917, he unified factions of the Liberal Party, leading it to victory in the 1921 election. The party was out of office during the harshest days of the Great Depression in Canada, 1930–35; King returned when the economy was on an upswing. He personally handled complex relations with the Prairie provinces, while his top aides Ernest Lapointe and Louis St. Laurent skillfully met the demands of French Canadians. During the Second World War, he carefully avoided the battles over conscription, patriotism and ethnicity that had divided Canada so deeply in the First World War. Though few major policy innovations took place during his premiership, he was able to synthesize and pass a number of measures that had reached a level of broad national support. Scholars attribute King's long tenure as party leader to his wide range of skills that were appropriate to Canada's needs. He understood the workings of capital and labour. Keenly sensitive to the nuances of public policy, he was a workaholic with a shrewd and penetrating intelligence and a profound understanding of the complexities of Canadian society. A modernizing technocrat who regarded managerial mediation as essential to an industrial society, he wanted his Liberal Party to represent liberal corporatism to create social harmony. King worked to bring compromise and harmony to many competing and feuding elements, using politics and government action as his instrument. He led his party for 29 years, led the country for just over 21 years, and established Canada's international reputation as a middle power fully committed to world order.King's biographers agree on the personal characteristics that made him distinctive. He lacked the charisma of such contemporaries as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, or Charles de Gaulle. He lacked a commanding presence or oratorical skill; his best writing was academic, and did not resonate with the electorate. Cold and tactless in human relations, he had many political allies but very few close personal friends. He never married and lacked a hostess whose charm could substitute for his chill. He kept secret his beliefs in spiritualism and use of mediums to stay in contact with departed associates and particularly with his mother, and allowed his intense spirituality to distort his understanding of Adolf Hitler throughout the late 1930s. A survey of scholars in 1997 by Maclean's magazine ranked King first among all Canada's prime ministers, ahead of John A. Macdonald and Wilfrid Laurier. As historian Jack Granatstein notes, ""the scholars expressed little admiration for King the man but offered unbounded admiration for his political skills and attention to Canadian unity."""

Arthur Meighen February 3 1932 October 22 1935 ,"Arthur Meighen  (; 16 June 1874 – 5 August 1960) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 9th prime minister of Canada, in office from July 1920 to December 1921 and from June to September 1926. He led the Conservative Party from 1920 to 1926 and from 1941 to 1942.Meighen was born in St. Marys, Ontario. His family came from Bovevagh near Dungiven in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. He studied mathematics at the University of Toronto, and then went on to Osgoode Hall Law School. After qualifying to practice law, he moved to Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. Meighen entered the House of Commons of Canada in 1908, aged 34, and in 1913 was appointed to the Cabinet of Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden. Under Borden, Meighen served as Solicitor General (1913–1917), Secretary of State for Canada (1917), Minister of Mines (1917; 1919–1920), Minister of the Interior (1917–1920), and Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs (1917–1920).In 1920, Meighen succeeded Borden as Conservative leader and Prime Minister – the first born after Confederation, and the only one from a Manitoba riding. He suffered a heavy defeat in the 1921 election to Mackenzie King and the Liberal Party, but re-entered Parliament through a 1922 by-election and remained as Opposition Leader. In the 1925 election, the Conservatives won a plurality of seats, just eight short of a majority government, but Mackenzie King decided to hold onto power with the support of the Progressives.Meighen's brief second term as Prime Minister came about as the result of the ""King–Byng Affair,"" being invited to form a ministry after Mackenzie King was refused an election request and resigned. He soon lost a no-confidence motion, however, and faced another federal election. Meighen lost his own seat, and the Conservatives lost 24, as Mackenzie King's Liberals re-took power.After losing the 1926 election, Meighen resigned as party leader and quit politics to return to his law practice. He was appointed to the Senate in 1932, and under R. B. Bennett served as Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister without Portfolio until 1935. In 1941, aged 67, Meighen became leader of the Conservatives for a second time, following Robert Manion's resignation. He attempted to re-enter the House of Commons in a by-election for York South, but lost to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation candidate and resigned as leader shortly thereafter."

Wishart McLea Robertson August 24 1945 October 14 1953 ,"Lester Bowles Pearson  (23 April 1897 – 27 December 1972) was a Canadian scholar, statesman, soldier, and diplomat who served as the 14th prime minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968, as the head of two back-to-back Liberal minority governments won in the elections of 1963 and 1965.Born in Toronto, Pearson pursued a career in the Department of External Affairs. From 1948 to 1957, he served as Secretary of State for External Affairs under Prime Ministers William Lyon Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent. He narrowly lost the bid to become Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1953. However, he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for organizing the United Nations Emergency Force to resolve the Suez Canal Crisis, which earned him praise and attention worldwide. After the Liberals' sudden defeat in the 1957 federal election, Pearson easily won the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1958. Pearson suffered two consecutive defeats by incumbent Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in 1958 and 1962, only to successfully challenge him for a third time in the 1963 federal election.During Pearson's tenure as prime minister, his government launched progressive policies such as universal health care, the Canada Student Loan Program, and the Canada Pension Plan. He also introduced the Order of Canada, and the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. Pearson oversaw the creation of the Maple Leaf flag that was implemented in 1965. His government unified Canada's armed forces and kept Canada out of the Vietnam War. In 1967, Canada became the first country in the world to implement a points-based immigration system. After nearly half a decade in power, Pearson resigned as Prime Minister and retired from politics.With his government programs and policies, together with his groundbreaking work at the United Nations and in international diplomacy, which included his role in ending the Suez Crisis, Pearson is generally considered among the most influential Canadians of the 20th century and is ranked among the greatest Canadian prime ministers."
